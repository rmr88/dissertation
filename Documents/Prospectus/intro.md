# Introduction

*Robbie Richards*

In an ideal representative democracy, the wishes of the people are translated directly into public policy, with each citizen receiving equal consideration in the representational function. This occurs through the actions of representatives, who are elected ostensibly to do what voters would do if asked to make the decision directly. When judging the representativeness of a government, scholars, pundits, and citizens alike often think in these terms, though with varying degrees of sophistication. However, this idealized picture often does not comport with reality. Public opinion and public policy regularly diverge, often significantly, even in societies that are zealously committed to democratic ideals.

For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) was passed by a narrow, partisan majority of Congress and has proceeded through many phases of implementation, despite the reported opposition of a majority of Americans. This public disapproval was manifest in many public opinion polls at the time of passage [@Blendon2010b]. As shown in Figure 1, the public has remained sharply divided, though with small but persistent pluralities or majorities in opposition. On the other hand, there has often been broad-based public support for various national health reform proposals [@Starr1982; @Starr2011], but none has ever become law, even temporarily, with the exception of Medicare in 1965 and the ACA. If America is supposedly a democratic society, why does public policy not reflect public opinion more closely?

In my dissertation, I propose to explore three factors that might affect the level of legislative responsiveness to public opinion in the United States: party competition, issue publics, and the characteristics of public opinion. These factors are all thought to have effects on responsiveness, based on various political science theories and models of the policy process, but further empirical testing is needed to validate some of these hypotheses. By conducting this analysis, we can not only validate theory but also explore the conditions under which the theories apply. This in turn will increase our understanding of the policy process and allow for refinement of theory where necessary. My analyses will generally focus on the US Congress, but will include some analyses at the state level and appropriate international comparisons where possible.

Classic political science models of representation are based on representation of the median voter, a conclusion drawn from formal modeling of governments formed by majoritarian/ plurality-rule electoral systems [@Downs1957]. There is empirical support for the hypothesis that policy responds to public opinion [@Miller1963; @Soroka2010; @Burstein2003], but there is also some debate as to what these findings mean [@Burstein2010].

Models of the policy process itself, including Kingdon's modified garbage can model [-@Kingdon1995], incrementalism [@Lindblom1965], punctuated equilibrium theory [PET; see @Jones2005; @True1999], and Sabatier's advocacy coalition framework [-@Sabatier1988], help give more context to representational dynamics. As shown by each of these models and the empirical observations cited in support of them, policymakers and the public are not the only actors in the policy process. Kingdon, for example, concludes that public opinion only operates in policymaking through the general sense policy makers have of the "national mood," rather than a more nuanced or sophisticated consultation of public opinion on specific issues. Public opinion constitutes only a part of what Kingdon calls the political stream. In addition, there are the policy and problem streams, which proceed entirely independent of politics and public opinion, with policy changes occuring only (but not always) when conditions in these independent streams align properly. PET also suggests a limited role for public opinion in policymaking, and only under certain circumstances. The incrementalist and advocacy coalition models offer even less opportunity for public opinion to affect policy.

Despite the differences between these models, they each suggest that public opinion may be constrained in its abiltiy to influence policy by other factors. Political elites, with their own goals, may be enabled by political institutions to exert their own independent influence, with public opinion acting more as a constraint than a driving force. The relative strength of institutions, such as legislative parties, can affect the link between public opinion and policy. It may also be the case that heterogeneity among the public itself has significant effects, distorting the signals that reach elected representatives. For example, politicians may pay more attention to the preferencves of certain "subconstituencies" on particular issues, allowing them to activate those groups in politically advantageous ways [@Bishin2009]. Finally, it could be the case that our measurement of public opinion is not sophisticated enough to provide policy makers any more than an imprecise, general picture of public preferences. Some studies suggest that polls have helped democratic governments to get a more accurate sense of public opinion [@Jacobs1993], and political scientists feel that polls could provide an important link between the public and their representatives [@Verba1996], but even polling can only provide a limited amount of information. This leaves elites to make their own judgment calls to fill in the gaps. 

For my dissertation, I plan to empirically analyze the factors mentioned above which might affect legislative responsiveness to public opinion. I will divide the analysis into three chapters, as follows:

1. Political parties provide organization for electoral and legislative politics. @Aldrich2010 and others hypothesize, and preliminary evidence supports the hypothesis [@AldrichForth], that increased party competition in a jurisdiction increases the responsiveness of elected officials individually and governments collectively to public opinion. Party competition may also increase political participation. In chapter 1, I will test these hypotheses, drawing on multiple measurements and data sources.
2. Issue publics, or groups of citizens with more intensely-held opinions about an issue than the rest of the population, may by their very existence send amplified signals to politicians, causing them to respond more to the issue public than to median public opinion. In previous work, Sunshine Hillygus and I have examined how the number of hunters in a congressional district affects House members' votes on gun bills. In the second chapter of my dissertation, I plan to use a similar approach to examine the effects of various issue publics on congressional support for health bills. The issue publics analyzed may include doctors, hospitals, the elderly, and the uninsured.
3. In chapter 3, I will analyze the dynamics of public opinion on a particular policy, the ACA. As mentioned above, polling on this subject has revealed deep divisions in public opinion, which have continued through the various phases of implementation. If the ACA were a simple, single policy proposal, we could take its passage as evidence that public opinion does not matter. However, the ACA is a very complex policy package, and there is preliminary evidence that there was significant public support for some pieces of the ACA [@Brodie2010]. It is possible that political elites paid attention to public opinion in their efforts to craft a bill that would pass. As a preliminary step to understand how this kind of bargaining would have to play out, we need to understand the nature of public opinion on the ACA. In this chapter, I will present the results of a survey experiment designed to detect changes in overall distributions of opinion on the ACA when certain parts of the law are made salient.

These hypotheses rest on theoretical frameworks specific to each topic. For example, there is a whole subfield of political science devoted to the study of political parties and their role in democracy. Therefore, my theoretical framework and specific hypotheses for analyzing parties are developed in chapter 1, separately from the other two chapters. This allows me to tap into the depth of research on this topic, while still maintaining a relevance to the policy process more generally in the context of this dissertation. I intend to write each chapter in such a way that it could stand stand on its own with minimal editing. Before moving into the individual chapters, I describe in general terms the concept of representation, which is the main dependent variable in the first two chapters, and the measurement issues involved in studying representation.

## Measuring Representation

The first two chapters will analyze representation directly. Measuring representation is of course important to studies like this, but there are many possible measures in the literature from which to choose, each with advantages and limitations. Representation can also be defined at the level of the individual legislator or the entire government (or legislature) in the context of either a single policy or some summary of policy issues. Different ways of conceptualizing representation can also be operationalized for analysis in different ways.

Perhaps the most common way of measuring representation is to use responsiveness, either of the legislator or of the entire legislative body. Responsiveness is essentially correlated movement on the margins. If the public expresses a conservative view on an issue, a responsive legislator or legislature will be relatively more supportive of the conservative option. This is most often measured by correlating estimated legislator ideal points with some measure of voter preferences, controlling for other factors. Testing representation defined as responsiveness in this manner is the most common approach used in political science to date.

Correspondence is a somewhat different concept, and perhaps a higher standard for representation. A correspondent legislator or legislature will not simply make marginal movements in line with public opinion, but will actually align itself with the median voter. Differences in position require measurement of legislator and constituenct preferences on the same ideological scale so a meaningful distance measure can be obtained, a measurement issue which is very difficult to solve. This difficulty is probably the main reason why researchers have not used correspondence measures as much in prior research, but the concept of correspondence as distinct from responsiveness is still important to note.[^1]

Measures of legislator and constituent preferences/ ideology are extremely important to measures of representation, whether responsiveness or correspondence is used. Legislator ideology is often based on roll call votes. Some studies use single roll call votes [e.g. @Clinton2006], but many use estimates based on parametric scaling of roll call votes, such as the commonly used DW-NOMINATE scores [@Carroll2015; @Carroll2009]. However, some have raised important issues with the use of roll call votes in this manner. Not all votes in congress are recorded, and the selection of votes that are recorded is neither random nor exogenous to the outcomes of the votes. Also, there are many reasons a legislator may choose to vote a particular way on a particular bill, some of which are strategic and therefore defy easy classification of a vote as responsive to public opinion or not. A "non-representative" vote on one bill could be meant to secure support from others in the chamber for another bill the legislator or his/ her constituents feel is more important than the first. Is the legislator being responsive or representative in this case? The answer is not entirely clear. Thus, roll call votes are an imperfect measure of legislator preferences.

Some alternatives to roll-call based measures have been suggested. Some researchers have applied parametric scaling techniques to cosponsorship data to obtain ideal point scores comparable to roll-call based estimates [@Aleman2009]. Another recent development is the use of campaign contributions to scale not only members of congress, but all state and federal elected officials based on the groups from which they received donations [@Bonica2014]. Surveys of legislators and candidates also offer opportunities to measure the concept of interest with high face validity [@Ansolabehere2001; @Shor2011]. Cosponsorship and contributions are not a perfect measures of ideology either, and are not as closely tied to the passage of policy, but they do provide another perspective on representation and responsiveness.

Some measures that have been used to capture voter preferences include presidential vote share in a legislator's district or state [e.g. @Ansolabehere2001], scaling techniques from large surveys or "big data" [@Xing2014], and modeled constituency opinions based on multilevel regression with poststratification [MRP; @Park2004]. As with the measures of legislator ideology, each of these measures is imperfect. Presidential vote share is generally easier to collect or access than the other two sources mentioned, but it is tied to electoral politics in addition to voter preferences, making it a tainted measure that may also be somewhat endogenous to legislative behavior [@Kernell2009].

The other two methods require substantial resources and are generally not available to all researchers or for very long time spans. Survey data that is sufficiently representative of all legislators' constituents is ideal for studying representation on specific policies, even in a correspondence framework, but may not be as useful for overall measures of representation because it is impossible to ask about all or even a significant number of bills a legislature will consider. Survey data that is representative of state-level opinion is becoming somewhat more common, but representative surveys of multiple congressional districts are not conducted. "Big data" is a possible source of representative data in smaller geographic jurisidictions, but generally will not have actual opinion estimates. Demographic and community characteristics can still be used to generate preference estimates, even on the same scale as legislator ideal point estimates to yield correspondence measures [@Xing2014].

In summary, there are different ways to both conceptualize and measure representation. Where possible, I intend to use multiple measures to test my hypotheses. I plan to collect available data on cosponsorships and roll calls to use in measuring legislator ideology. I also plan to use not only presidential vote share, but also large-scale surveys like the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) and the National Annenberg Election Study (NAES), large-N datasets from Catalist [@Xing2014], and estimates from MRP methods where possible and appropriate.
