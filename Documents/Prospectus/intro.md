# Introduction

In an ideal representative democracy, the wishes of the people are translated directly into public policy, with each citizen receiving equal consideration in the representational function. This occurs through the actions of representatives, who are elected ostensibly to do what voters would do if asked to make the decision directly. When judging the representativeness of a government, scholars, pundits, and citizens alike often think in these terms, though with varying degrees of sophistication. However, this idealized picture often does not comport with reality. Public opinion and public policy regularly diverge, often significantly, even in societies that are zealously committed to democratic ideals.

![Figure 1: ACA Public Approval Since Passage](C:\Users\Robbie\Documents\dissertation\Analysis\Figs\fig1.png)

For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) was passed Congress by a narrow, partisan majority and has proceeded through many phases of implementation, despite the reported opposition of a majority of Americans. This public disapproval was manifest in many public opinion polls at the time of passage [@Blendon2010b]. As shown in Figure 1, the public has remained sharply divided, though with small but persistent pluralities or majorities in opposition. On the other hand, there has often been broad-based public support for various national health reform proposals [@Starr1982; @Starr2011], but none has ever become law, even temporarily, with the exception of Medicare in 1965 and the ACA. If America is a democratic society, why does public policy not reflect public opinion more closely?

Classic political science models of representation predict that representatives will follow the all-important median voter, a conclusion drawn from formal modeling of governments formed by majoritarian/ plurality-rule electoral systems [@Downs1957]. There is empirical support for the hypothesis that policy responds to public opinion [@Miller1963; @Soroka2010; @Burstein2003], but there is also some debate as to what these findings mean [@Burstein2010].

Models of the policy process itself, including Kingdon's modified garbage can model [-@Kingdon1995], incrementalism [@Lindblom1965], punctuated equilibrium theory [PET; see @Jones2005; @True1999], and Sabatier's advocacy coalition framework [-@Sabatier1988], help give more context to representational dynamics. As shown by each of these models and the empirical observations cited in support of them, policymakers and the public are not the only actors in the policy process. Kingdon, for example, concludes that public opinion only operates in policymaking through the general sense policy makers have of the "national mood," rather than a more nuanced or sophisticated consultation of public opinion on specific issues. Public opinion constitutes only a part of what Kingdon calls the political stream. In addition, there are the policy and problem streams, which proceed entirely independent of politics and public opinion, with policy changes occurring only (but not always) when conditions in these independent streams align properly. PET also suggests a limited role for public opinion in policymaking, and only under certain circumstances. The incrementalist and advocacy coalition models offer even less opportunity for public opinion to affect policy.

Despite the differences between these models, they each suggest that public opinion is constrained in its ability to influence policy by other factors. Political elites, with their own goals, may be enabled by political institutions to exert their own independent influence, with public opinion acting more as a constraint than a driving force. The relative strength of institutions, such as legislative parties, can affect the link between public opinion and policy. It may also be the case that heterogeneity among the public itself has significant effects, distorting the signals that reach elected representatives. For example, politicians may pay more attention to the preferences of certain "subconstituencies" on particular issues, allowing them to activate those groups in politically advantageous ways [@Bishin2009]. Furthermore, it may be the case that our measurement of public opinion is not sophisticated enough to provide policy makers any more than an imprecise, general picture of public preferences. Some studies suggest that polls have helped democratic governments to get a more accurate sense of public opinion [@Jacobs1993], and political scientists feel that polls could provide an important link between the public and their representatives [@Verba1996], but even the most sophisticated modern polls can only provide a limited amount of information. This leaves elites to make their own judgment calls to fill in the gaps.

In my dissertation, I propose to explore these three factors that might affect the level of legislative responsiveness to public opinion in the United States: party competition, issue publics, and the characteristics of public opinion itself. These factors are all thought to have effects on responsiveness, based on various political science theories and models of the policy process, but further empirical testing is needed to validate some of these hypotheses. By conducting this analysis, we can not only validate theory but also explore the conditions under which the theories apply. This in turn will increase our understanding of the policy process and allow for refinement of theory where necessary. My analyses will generally focus on the US Congress, but may include some analyses at the state level and appropriate international comparisons where possible.

I will divide the dissertation into three chapters, described in detail in the following sections. Each of the three chapters will consider one of the three factors mentioned above. I intend to write each chapter so it can stand on its own as a published article with very minimal editing, but for the dissertation I will include brief introductory and concluding sections in addition to the main chapters themselves.

# Chapter 1: Party Competition

## Hypotheses and Model Specification

Political parties serve a basic organizational function for electoral and legislative politics. @Aldrich2010 and others hypothesize, and preliminary evidence supports the hypothesis [@AldrichForth], that increased party competition in a jurisdiction increases the responsiveness of elected officials individually and governments collectively to public opinion. In chapter 1, I will test this party competition hypothesis, drawing on multiple measurements and data sources.

The party competition hypothesis builds on the much-debated marginality hypothesis, which predicts that elected officials who face stronger electoral competition will be more responsive to their constituents. Despite the theoretical strength of this prediction, it has not always been supported by empirical tests. While some scholars find evidence of responsiveness to electoral competition [e.g. @Ansolabehere2001; @Griffin2006], others find electoral competition does not affect responsiveness [e.g. @Fiorina1973; @Gerber1995; @Groseclose2001].

The first hypothesis for this chapter is that increased party competition will affect an elected official's responsiveness to his/ her constituents' opinions. To be more operationally specific, higher measures of party competition in a state will be associated with a stronger positive correlation between the ideology/ legislative behaviors of members of the US Congress and the ideology/ opinions of their constituents (state opinion for Senators, district opinion for House members). Using data on legislators who hold office $o$ (Senate and each House race are given unique values of $o$) in state $s$ at time $t$, I will construct the following model to test my hypothesis:

$$
Legislator\ Ideology_{ost} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Constituent\ Ideology_{ost} + \beta_2 Party\ Competition_{ost} + \beta_3 (Constituent\ Ideology_{ost} * Party\ Competition_{ost}) + \beta_4 (other\ controls) + \alpha_t + \epsilon_{ost}
$$

Generally, representation is measured in the manner represented by $\beta_1$, which is the correlation between legislator ideology and constituent ideology. The coefficient of interest for this chapter is the interaction term, $\beta_3$, which can be interpreted as the effect of party competition on representation (holding constituent opinion and other variables constant). If we define representation itself as the change in legislator ideology with respect to changes in constituent ideology, we can take the partial derivative of the equation above with respect to constituent ideology to obtain a stylized representation function showing that representation varies with the level of party competition:

$$
\frac{\partial (Legislator\ Ideology_{ost})}{\partial (Constituent\ Ideology_{ost})} = \beta_1 + \beta_3 Party\ Competition_{ost}
$$

Given the coding of my measures (to be discussed below), a significant, positive $\beta_3$ will provide support for my hypothesis that party competition affects representation. I will obtain estimates of $\beta_3$ by estimating the first equation above.

I can estimate similar models that look at different aspects of the relationship between representation and party competition. For example, it is possible that the effect of party competition on representation (i.e. the value of $\beta_3$) varies over time. @AldrichForth show that parties in the American South have only become competitive in the past two or three decades, which they also show is related to a rise in responsiveness of Southern legislators. To examine the time-varying nature of $\beta_3$, I could estimate equation 1 separately for each election cycle $t$ (omitting, of course, the year fixed effects $\alpha_t$). I will also explore models by incumbent party, given that other research [@Clinton2006] and preliminary analyses discussed below indicate interesting qualitative differences across parties in representational behaviors.

## Measurement of Key Variables

In order to estimate the equation above, I will need measures of legislator ideology, constituent ideology, and party competition. Measurement of these key concepts will need to be considered carefully. My strategy in general will be to run multiple specifications of my models, using many different measures of the variables of interest, in order to increase confidence that my results are not driven by the assumptions of any single measure.

### Legislator Ideology

For the dependent variable, I plan to use existing measures of representative ideology. I will probably rely mostly on the roll call-based DW-NOMINATE scores [@Carroll2015; @Carroll2009]. These scores are available for all Congresses back to 1789, and are commonly used in scholarly research on Congress. However, many objections to the use of roll call votes as measures of legislator ideology have been raised, so I will supplement my analysis with alternative model specifications that use other measures, such as Bonica's campaign finance scores [-@Bonica2014]. I may also estimate a model for state legislators using Shor and McCarty's survey-based NPAT scores for state legislatures [-@Shor2011]. In all cases, I will translate the measures so that lower values represent conservative legislators, and higher values represent liberal legislators.

### Constituent Ideology

The most commonly used measure of constituent ideology in studies of American politics is two-party presidential vote share in the state or congressional district [e.g. @AldrichForth; @Griffin2006]. I will use the Democratic share of the vote in the most recent presidential election for the year in question. For presidential elections back to 1992, data on the vote by congressional district is available. Before that time, I will need to use county-level data mapped onto congressional districts. I am still trying to figure out how to accomplish this, but I believe I am close. I have the county-level data and GIS boundary definition files for counties and congressional districts. My biggest obstacle at this point is deciding how to handle the many counties that are part of multiple congressional districts. I will look at past work, such as @Ansolabehere2001, for ideas.

Presidential vote share, like DW-NOMINATE scores, has the advantages of being readily available for long periods of time and being widely used in political science research. However, there are also known issues with this measure [@Kernell2009]. Steps can be taken to mitigate some of the issues, such as demeaning by year to obtain a measure that is comparable across years, but this still does not solve all the measurement problems. Where possible, I will again supplement my analyses with alternative measures of constituent ideology. I could use survey data from large-N surveys such as the Cooperative Congressional Election Study and the National Annenberg Election Study (both of which are publicly accessible) and multi-level regression/ post-stratification measures, such as those created by Tausanovitch and Warshaw [-@Tausanovitch2013].

I also have access to a dataset containing estimates of legislator and constituent ideology on the same scale, which allows for a direct measure of the ideological distance between legislators and their constituents. These estimates, calculated by @Xing2014, would allow me to estimate a model that looks more like the second equation given above, with additional control variables added. This data is only available for the 111th Congress, but using it would allow for yet another robustness check on my results from other specifications.

### Party Competition

For the third variable of interest, party competition, I propose a new measure based on election data. Where possible, I will use election data from all congressional, statewide executive, and state legislative elections in a state in a given election cycle.[^1] I will sum, for all races included in the index, the raw Democratic vote total, and divide by the sum of the two-party vote totals (Republicans plus Democrats) to obtain a percentage of major party votes captured by the Democrats. I will calculate this index by office $o$ in state $s$ at time $t$, excluding the office for which the index is being calculated from both the numerator and denominator. For example, when calculating an index for party competition for Alabama's first congressional district (AL-1) in 2014, I will use data from all elections held in Alabama that election cycle *except* the results from district AL-1. I will omit special elections. Mathematically, the basis for the index can be written as:

$$
Democratic\ Competition_{o_nst} = \frac{\sum_{o|o\neq o_n}^{}Democratic\ Votes_{ost}}{\sum_{o|o\neq o_n}^{}Total\ Two\ Party\ Vote_{ost}}
$$

When this measure equals 1, Democrats are running uncontested in the state. Republicans are uncontested when the measure is 0. At an index value of 0.5, the two major parties are locked in perfect competition. To obtain a unidimensional measure of party competition, I will fold the results obtained above using the expression $1 - |Democratic\ Competition_{o_nst} - 0.5|$. This will yield an index that ranges from 0.5 (one-party dominance) to 1 (perfect party competition).

There are many existing measures of party competition in the literature [e.g. @Ranney1976; @Holbrook1993; @Ceaser2005]. The problem I see with existing measures for my purposes[^2] is that all were developed for analysis of the effects of party competition in a state on state-level policy. Many use control of state government, which although correlated with election outcomes, is not quite the same as electoral competition. Many indices do not include national election data. Those that do often include presidential vote, which I do not feel should be included in a measure of party competition aimed at measuring the responsiveness of members of Congress. At the very least, inclusion of presidential vote would probably increase the collinearity of party competition with constituent ideology if the latter is also measured by presidential vote. To assess robustness of my results to different measures of party competition, I plan to estimate alternate specifications of my models using three indices, which represent a good sample of all the available indices: the Ranney Index [@Ranney1976], the Holbrook and Van Dunk index [HVD; @Holbrook1993], and Ceaser and Saldin's [-@Ceaser2005] Major Party Competition index.

## Preliminary Results

I have collected enough data so far to conduct preliminary versions of my proposed analysis. Table 1 below shows five specifications of my main model. All five use DW-NOMINATE scores for legislator ideology and presidential vote share (by state, unadjusted) for constituent ideology. The first three use my party competition measure described above, while models 4 and 5 use the Ranney and HVD indices respectively, as indicated in the column headers. Models 2 and 3 break the data down by incumbent party (Democrats and Republicans, respectively). Years included in the model are indicated in the table as well.

Table 1: Preliminary Models of Representation

[Table 1 here]

Standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01

The positive interaction terms, found in the shaded rows of Table 1, indicate that as party competition increases, legislator responsiveness to public opinion also increases. All else equal, elected officials in states with more partisan competition are more likely to move to the left as their constituents become more liberal. The interactions are significant for all models, with the exception of model 2 for Democrats only. This finding shows an interesting difference in the representative behaviors of the parties in general, and I plan to explore this further empirically.

The substantive sizes of these effects are depicted in Figure 2 below. The figure shows the expected change in a legislator's DW-NOMINATE score in response to a shift in constituents' presidential vote share from 0% Democratic to 100% Democratic at different levels of party competition.[^3] Overall, a shift from no competition to perfect party competition increases this marginal effect by about 0.18 points on the NOMINATE scale, which ranges from -1 to 1. For Republicans in particular, the effect is even larger, about 0.28 points.

![Figure 2: Effects of Party Competition on Representation, Election-based Index](C:\Users\Robbie\Documents\dissertation\Analysis\Figs\fig2.png)

Figure 3 compares the results of models 1, 4, and 5, which use different party competition measures. The interpretation is the same as that for Figure 2. The Ranney index has the same scale as my party competition measure, but note the alternate horizontal scale for the HVD index. In all models, party competition has a sizable effect on responsiveness. This is shown most dramatically by the HVD index, with potential change in DW-NOMINATE scores increasing by more than 0.8 across the range of the HVD scale. However, this may be more an effect of the different time frames covered by the different indices. The 1970's and 1980's saw major changes in the ideological composition of the two major parties in Congress and in the electorate, which could be driving the results in model 5 in the absence of other decades.

![Figure 3: Effects of Party Competition on Representation, Indices Compared](C:\Users\Robbie\Documents\dissertation\Analysis\Figs\fig3.png)

I need to collect data for more variables conduct further analyses to assess the robustness of these results and to get the measures and model specifications up to the standards outlined above. I have some control variables included in these models, but need to collect the data to include more, particularly legislator-specific ones such as gender, race, age, and religion. If there are any suggestions on how to improve my analyses, I would appreciate the feedback.

## Causal Inference

To develop this study further, I am trying to create an empirical strategy that would allow for more direct causal inference. It would be nice to be able to say with more certainty that party competition *causes* greater responsiveness, in line with the predictions of political science theory, but endogeneity in the concepts I am measuring prevent me from saying that the data unambiguously support a causal conclusion. Ideally, I would like to identify a source of exogenous variation in party competition that could be used as an instrumental variable in the model. I have considered redistricting/ reapportionment, or the population shifts that precede these changes in district boundaries, as a possibility. Another that I am less certain of is funding from a national party organization for competitive races. This funding comes from the national organization, which is separate from the state entities my party competition indices are measuring. However, I need to think through and research this one more thoroughly. Any suggestions on this aspect of the project will be extremely helpful.

# Chapter 2: Group Interests

Issue publics, or groups of citizens with more intensely-held opinions about an issue than the rest of the population [@Krosnick1990], may by their very existence send amplified signals to politicians, causing politicians in turn to respond more to perceived group interests than to overall public opinion. In the second chapter of my dissertation, I will examine the effect of unorganized groups on representation. This kind of study requires focus on a specific set of groups and policy issues relevant to those groups. Therefore, I will analyze the effects of various health care-related groups on legislative representation in the area of health policy.

In previous work, Sunshine Hillygus and I examined how the number of hunters in a congressional district affected House members' votes on a couple of gun bills. We find that there is indeed a correlation between support for the pro-gun bills and the proportion of voters in a district who are hunters, even after controlling for census region, partisanship, median district opinion, and campaign contributions from groups like the NRA. That study, along with another recent study testing a similar hypothesis about representation on LGB issues [@Hansen2015], serve as the proof of concept for the analysis in this chapter.

This chapter will extend our understanding of how perceived group interests affect representation by examining an issue area with a more complicated group structure. The groups surrounding gun policy and LGB policy are quite simple in terms of group structures and dimensionality of the issue. There is really only one relevant group with inherent interest in each topic: gun owners/ hunters for gun policy, and gay/ lesbian/ bisexual individuals for LGB issues. Organized groups have arisen on both sides of these issues, but still the group structure and issue area remain unidimensional. Health policy, on the other hand, has perhaps the most complex group structure of any policy topic. Many distinct groups are often at odds with each other in health policy debates, and which groups agree with each other depends on the specific issue being discussed. For example, physicians and other health care providers generally oppose the recent wave of consolidation in the private health insurance industry, standing in direct opposition to payer interests. Providers are joined in this fight by many patient groups. However, on the issue of Medicare payment rates, the interests of providers, patients, and payers (at least the Medicare/ Medicaid carriers) are much more closely aligned. Whereas prior research has examined relatively simple issues, I propose to examine the much more complex issue of health policy to see if the same predictions about perceived group interests and representation hold.

It is also important to note that this research is distinct from prior research on interest groups. As Sunshine Hillygus and I argue in our paper on gun politics, there is an important distinction between organized interest groups and perceived group interests. When I refer to the interests of doctors in this chapter, I mean doctors collectively as an unorganized group of voters, not the American Medical Association (AMA) and other medical trade groups. There is evidence that the AMA, for example, is not always perfectly representative of the group it claims to represent [@Starr1982]. To the extent that legislators see groups of doctors in their district, or groups of nurses, or senior citizens (Medicare beneficiaries), or any other groups, they may be considering the perceived interests of those groups *separately from* the interests of the AMA, the American Nurses Association (ANA), or the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). I will control for the influence of organized groups in my analyses, with the expectation of finding *independent* influence from the existence/ size of latent, unorganized groups.

## Proposed Analysis

The analysis for this chapter will involve many similar concepts to those used in the first chapter. I will need measures of legislator views and behaviors on health policy, as well as constituent opinions on health policy. For this, I will need to identify relevant datasets. Survey-based data will be most helpful in this chapter for measuring constituent views. I will also attempt to use the data from @Xing2014 in alternative specifications.

For legislators, I will probably be examining votes on and/ or cosponsorship of specific health-related bills in Congress. I will identify such bills using Scott Adler and John Wilkerson's Congressional Bills Project, which codes all bills introduced from 1947 to 2008 by topic. There is enough detail in the codes to identify subtopics within the broader category of health policy (major topic code 3), such as "comprehensive health care reform" (topic 301), "insurance reform, availability, and cost" (topic 302), and "regulation of drug industry, medical devices, and clinical labs" (topic 321).

In addition to legislator and constituent opinions, I will also need data on the sizes of various groups in states and congressional districts. I hope to collect such data on at least five groups: doctors, hospitals, the uninsured, the elderly, and Medicaid recipients. For doctors, I have practice data on all providers who billed Medicare in 2012. Using practice address, I geocoded this data and merged it with a congressional district map, thus linking all matched providers to a state and a congressional district. The assumption that providers affect the votes of the member of Congress in whose district they *practice* (as opposed to district of residence) is not ideal, but is still defensible for two reasons. First, it is plausible to assume that doctors live close to their practices. In some urban/ geographically small districts, this may be somewhat more problematic, but controlling for population density could help with this specific component measurement error. Second, even if a doctor does not live in a congressional district, it is likely that both members of Congress and their actual constituents will be somewhat familiar with businesses in their districts, including doctors offices. Members of Congress may want to keep economic actors in their districts happy, and doctors have at times been known to transmit political messages to their patients/ customers [@Starr1982]. Thus, although the use of practice address is imprecise, it is likely to still provide a fairly good measure of issue public strength, one that will do well at representing the signals actually perceived by members of Congress.

For the uninsured, elderly (specifically, Medicare beneficiaries), and Medicaid recipients, data can potentially be collected from a number of sources. Estimates of the first two at least are available from the Catalist data used by @Xing2014. Estimates of all three might be available from Census Bureau sources, particularly the Small Area Health Insurance Estimates data. The states may collect data on Medicaid recipients. If actual (or estimated) enrollments for the public payers cannot be obtained, I could use demographic data, such as age and income, to estimate the enrollment rates.

Hospitals obviously do not fit the standard definition of an issue public, in that they are organizations, not people, and certainly not voters. However, I still plan to analyze the effect the number of hospitals in a state/ district has on legislative behavior because, as with doctors, hospitals tend to be very visible features of a community. A high concentration of hospitals in a district may be something to which members of Congress pay attention. To the extent legislators pay attention to hospitals rather than voters, hospitals may be thought of as a "quasi-issue public." Self-interest can certainly give rise to issue publics defined strictly as groups of individuals, and it is worth testing whether the same dynamic occurs for organizations. More hospitals could also indicate a strong medical industry, with many doctors, nurses, and other health care providers in the area. I will need to interpret effects of hospitals more carefully, but it may reveal some interesting findings to be explored in future research. I will look into obtaining hospital location grodata from a government agency (CMS, HHS, or CDC) or from an industry group like the American Hospital Association.

I would appreciate any suggestions you have on data sources for identifying any of these five groups geographically. In addition, I am open to suggestions about other groups I could include in my analysis, especially if there is already data on them, such as cancer patients/ survivors, people with diabetes, nurses and other health industry employees, and insurance industry employees, to name a few.

Another important variable for this project will be the activities of organized interest groups relevant to health policy, including payers, providers (which can be further divided into doctors, nurses, and other medical employees), patient advocacy groups, and hospital trade associations, to name a few. I will collect this data from the Center for Responsive Politics’ website, opensecrets.org, which has campaign contribution data classified by industry/ cause.

Once I have assembled the data, I hope to estimate models of legislator behavior as a function of constituent opinions, proportions of the groups identified in the district, campaign contributions from related interest groups, legislator partisanship, other relevant control variables, and state fixed effects. Because the dependent variables in these models are binary (roll call votes and cosponsorships), I will estimate them as logit models. I will estimate a model for each bill, and summarize the relevant coefficients in my write-up of the results, similar to the method used in @Clinton2006. I will analyze overall tendencies in all the models, as well as by health policy subtopic. If I do decide to combine the dependent variables into a scale of some sort, I will use either ordered logit (for a scale with a small number of discrete categories) or OLS.

I will also look briefly at models that employ interactions between the variables of interest, similar to what I have done in chapter 1, but I am less certain that interactions will be helpful in this case. In our work on gun policy, Sunshine Hillygus and I found that our group variables entirely overpowered the effects of median constituent views, rendering those variables insignificant. Interaction terms between the group proportion and median voter variables were also not significant, indicating that groups were independently accounting for variation in legislator votes rather than moderating the effect of the median voter.

I am also less concerned about endogeneity in this chapter because the exogeneity of group sizes to individual legislative votes is more plausible. While overall policies might affect the geographic distribution of groups like doctors and Medicaid beneficiaries, members of these groups are unlikely to make a conscious effort to relocate to a congressional district or even a state simply because a representative voted for or will vote for a particular bill at the Federal level. Such votes will generally affect national policy, and the benefits can therefore be gained in many parts of the country, without necessarily being one of the legislator's direct constituents. I will still be careful to interpret my findings as correlational/ descriptive rather than causal because I cannot claim to have accounted fully for omitted variable bias or measurement error, and I certainly think that future causal studies on this topic should be conducted. At this point in the research on perceived group interests, however, I feel that laying the descriptive framework for future causal studies will be the most beneficial way to proceed.

# Chapter 3: Public Opinion Measurement

## Motivation

While factors external to public opinion provide one source of explanations for differences in representation, it is also important to consider the nature of public opinion itself. A naive way to define representation is to say that members of Congress should vote in line with public opinion polls on a topic. Putting aside the obvious problem of coverage (not every issue decided in Congress is covered in public opinion polls), this notion is also challenged by the mismatch between the simplicity of poll data and the complexity of both policy design and actual public opinion. Methodologically, it is good practice for survey researchers to keep questions and surveys simple and concise, and to only deal with a single concept in a particular question. Policy, on the other hand, is almost never that simple.

In order to understand how public opinion may or may not influence elected officials, I argue that it is important to step back and think about what we really mean when we talk about "public opinion." Referring back to Figure 1, presented in the very beginning of this prospectus, we could argue that this picture of public opinion on the ACA glosses over important nuances and caveats. It may be that asking for a simple favorability rating of a policy as complex as the ACA entirely masks support for or opposition to specific pieces of the law. @Brodie2010 find that when pollsters ask about specific policies contained in the ACA, many pieces of the law are favored by overwhelming majorities, despite the widespread consistent opposition to the package as a whole. Figure 1 showed only this latter conclusion, yet popular accounts of public opinion on the ACA often go no further than Figure 1. Chapter three is intended to explore the former conclusion and its broader implications for representation.

The goal of this study is not to directly measure representation or factors that affect it, as previous chapters have done, but rather to present some aspects of public opinion which may be important to understanding representational dynamics. I do not intend to create a new theory, but rather to apply the predictions of well-known public opinion theories, such as Zaller's [-@Zaller1992a] memory-based model of the survey response, to a specific policy area and begin to map the previously unexplored contours of opinion in that area.

## Summary of the Project

This chapter of my dissertation is already in the last stages of writing. I conducted a survey experiment on public opinion on the Affordable Care Act (ACA), in which I primed some respondents to think about specific policy changes in the law before reporting their opinion of the law in general. A former version of this chapter comprised the empirical paper I submitted as part of my comprehensive exam requirements. In the study, I hypothesize that respondents primed to think about specific pieces of the ACA would have a different distribution of opinions and that the predictors of those opinions would differ across treatment groups.

To set up the test of these hypotheses, I randomly assigned my experimental subjects into one of four groups. Each group had a different version of the survey, which allowed me to manipulate who was primed and with what specific policy they were primed. I chose two specific policies to prime/ ask about: the ACA's individual mandate and the provision requiring that young adults under age 26 be allowed to stay on their parents' insurance plans (the young adult coverage provision, for short). Figure 4 shows the flow of the initial portion of the survey for each of the four groups. All respondents also answered some basic demographic questions at the end of the survey. I compare groups 1 and 2 (the individual mandate groups) directly, and groups 3 and 4 (the young adult coverage groups) directly, but it is not appropriate to make other direct comparisons (i.e. comparisons between 1 and 4, or 2 and 3, etc).

![Figure 4: Experimental Design](C:\Users\Robbie\Documents\dissertation\Analysis\Figs\fig3-1.png)

Based on the results of the experiment, I find that distributions of opinion on the ACA overall were indeed different across treatment groups when the primed policy was the young adult coverage provision. When the individual mandate was primed, opinions did not differ across the primed and unprimed groups overall, but did differ when looking at only those in both groups who opposed the individual mandate. These results are depicted graphically in Figure 5 below. Because of the random assignment to experimental conditions, it is appropriate to conclude that priming specific parts of the ACA does indeed affect opinions of the ACA overall.

![Figure 5: ACA Favorability by Experimental Group and Provision Support](C:\Users\Robbie\Documents\dissertation\Analysis\Figs\fig3-3.png)

By running OLS models of ACA opinion for each of the four experimental groups and comparing the coefficients, I am also able to show that at least for the individual mandate groups, predictors of ACA opinions changed when the individual mandate was primed. Figure 6 graphically shows the comparison between the coefficients from the four models. Greater divergence between coefficients for the same variable across groups indicates that the predictors of ACA opinion are different across those groups. In particular, partisanship becomes less important in predicting ACA opinion, while the effect of the respondent's opinion of the individual mandate increases. There were no significant differences across models for the young adult coverage groups.

What these results indicate from a policy standpoint is that public opinion might be more complex than what mass polling indicates. Certainly there is significant opposition to the ACA as a whole, but the interpretation of that fact is not so simple. It could be that opposition to the ACA centers on opposition to specific key pieces of the law, such as the individual mandate. It may also be that if people understood the law more fully or thought more about what it actually does (rather than abotu their party identification or attitudes toward President Obama), they would favor it more [see also @Gross2012]. Alternatively, it could be that members of Congress can use the complexity of the ACA to keep their constituents from seeing things they do not like by pointing out the parts they would like, thus anticipating potential opposition and preempting it through strategic messaging [see also @Bradley2014]. The results of this study have implications for the way we think about what it means to represent public opinion.

There are also practical implications for the kinds of policies activists and policy makers might want to support or include in large reform packages. Legislative strategy plays off of the nuances identified by my study very well. Crafting a package that has enough support for specific pieces to outweigh overall partisan/ ideological opposition is a good strategy for elected politicians, according to these results. Both the strategy and the features of public opinion that allow it deserve further analysis.

The main items left to accomplish for this chapter are to develop the theoretical framework further and revise the introduction to make it more current. The appendix entry for this chapter contains the latest version of the paper. This draft will be edited for the final submission of the dissertation, but the data collection and analysis is already complete. Ideally, I would like feedback on framing the analysis and structuring the paper.

# Plan for Completion

*Table 2: Proposed Timeline for Completion*

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time         Goal
------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
April 2016   Prospectus defense, continue data collection (end of 3rd year in residence)

Summer 2016  Finish data collection for chapters 1 and 2, editing for chapter 3

Fall 2016    Conduct analysis for and write chapters 1 and 2

Spring 2017  Finish writing/ editing, including intro and conclusion

April 2017   Defend dissertation if ready (end of 4th year in residence)

Summer 2017- Extra time if needed (5th year in residence)
Spring 2018
------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table 2 presents what I believe to be a realistic timeline for completion of the proposed dissertation. I believe I can finish by next April because for the first two chapters, I have begun data collection and a literature review, and I have early indications of what the results will be. As detailed above, chapter 3 is even farther along. Given that I have funding for this summer, I may even be able to push ahead of schedule before my work obligations (20 hours/ week of either TA or RA work) resume in the Fall. Even if things do take longer than expected, I will still have regular funding for a fifth year (with work requirements), which will certainly give enough time to complete the proposed research projects.

[^1]: For states that hold odd-year elections for state offices, I will combine these elections with the next even-year federal election. Unfortunately, election data before the 1950's (other than federal and gubernatorial) are not generally available. For elections in that time frame, I will still be able to calculate a party competition measure using what limited data are available. I will obviously want to be sure the composition of the index over time is not driving any results I generate using this index.

[^2]: I do not intend to critique these measures in general, as all have been applied appropriately to other research questions. I merely argue that my index better captures the particular aspect of party competition in which I am most interested.

[^3]: A swing in presidential vote from 0 to 100% Democratic is not likely to be observed for most districts, but the observed range of presidential vote share is actually quite large. In the data used for model 1, state-level support for the Democratic presidential candidate ranges from about a minimum of 20% to a 99th percentile of about 66% (there are some outliers at 100%, probably due to Republican presidential candidates failing to make it onto the ballot in some state-years). It is likely that the range of district-level vote shares is at least this large. For the actual write-up, I will probably take the time to generate figures using the realistic range, but the qualitative nature of the results will not change.
