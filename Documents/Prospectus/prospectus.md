# Introduction

*Robbie Richards*

In an ideal representative democracy, the wishes of the people are translated directly into public policy, with each citizen receiving equal consideration in the representational function. This occurs through the actions of representatives, who are elected ostensibly to do what voters would do if asked to make the decision directly. When judging the representativeness of a government, scholars, pundits, and citizens alike often think in these terms, though with varying degrees of sophistication. However, this idealized picture often does not comport with reality. Public opinion and public policy regularly diverge, often significantly, even in societies that are zealously committed to democratic ideals.

![Figure 1: ACA Public Approval Since Passage](C:\Users\Robbie\Documents\dissertation\Figs\fig1.png)

For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) was passed by a narrow, partisan majority of Congress and has proceeded through many phases of implementation, despite the reported opposition of a majority of Americans. This public disapproval was manifest in many public opinion polls at the time of passage [@Blendon2010b]. As shown in Figure 1, the public has remained sharply divided, though with small but persistent pluralities or majorities in opposition. On the other hand, there has often been broad-based public support for various national health reform proposals [@Starr1982; @Starr2011], but none has ever become law, even temporarily, with the exception of Medicare in 1965 and the ACA. If America is supposedly a democratic society, why does public policy not reflect public opinion more closely, even on these and other high-profile issues?

In my dissertation, I propose to explore three factors that might affect the level of legislative responsiveness to public opinion in the United States: party competition, issue publics, and the characteristics of public opinion. These factors are all thought to have effects on representation, based on various political science theories and models of the policy process, but further empirical testing is needed to validate some of these hypotheses. By conducting this analysis, we can not only validate theory but also explore the conditions under which theory applies. This in turn will increase our understanding of the policy process and allow for refinement of theory where necessary. My analyses will generally focus on the US Congress, but will include some analyses at the state level and appropriate international comparisons where possible.

## Theories of the Policy Process

Classic political science models of representation are based on representation of the median voter, a conclusion drawn from formal modeling of governments formed by majoritarian/ plurality-rule electoral systems [ex. @Downs1957]. There is empirical support for the hypothesis that policy responds to public opinion [@Miller1963; @Soroka2010; @Burstein2003], but there is also some debate as to what these findings mean [@Burstein2010]. While influential models of the policy process deal with representation of the public's views to some extent, they tend to reach different conclusions on whether representation is expected to be strong or weak. Other factors are often presented as more important, sometimes even rendering empirical findings of responsiveness theoretically spurious rather than causal. However, the models disagree in important ways. Part of the issue seems to be the different evidentiary bases for the models. Different cases are used to validate different models, leading to different conclusions. By understanding each of the significant models in turn, however, we can start to see some patterns in terms of when public opinion has a significant effect on policy and when it does not. In this section, I briefly explain four of these models.

### Kingdon's Modified Garbage Can Model

In Kingdon's [-@Kingdon1995] modified garbage can model of the policy process, agenda and policy change occur as three separate streams, the policy, problem, and political streams, come into alignment. This alignment occurs as a result of the actions of policy entrepreneurs, who are seeking some sort of policy benefit. Policy entrepreneurs have incentives that may or may not line up with those of the public, leading to a potential conflict between public opinion and entrepreneur/ elite opinion.

Kingdon's model does allow public opinion to affect policy, to the extent that policy makers can detect and discern it. However, they do this imperfectly, getting a "feel" for the national mood, rather than always looking at exact percentages from the latest polls on all important issues. Some studies suggest that polls have helped democratic governments to get a more accurate sense of public opinion [@Jacobs1993], and political scientists feel that polls could provide an important link between the public and their representatives [@Verba1996], but even polling can only provide a limited amount of information. Kingdon views public opinion as a potential constraint on policy change, but not a driving force. Policy makers are often left open, within constraints set by their imperfect sense of public opinion, to the influence of policy entrepreneurs and their own inclinations.

### Incrementalism

Incrementalist theories of public policy [see @Lindblom1965] highlight the political conflict inherent in policy change and conclude that because of powerful interests and institutions, significant policy changes are generally kept off the agenda. This makes for a weakened public, unable to effectively promote its position. As a result, policy change happens incrementally, with vested interests successfully keeping major changes off the table.

Incrementalists make important contributions to our understanding of policy elites as independent actors. First, they point out the tension between analysis as an alternative to politics and analysis as politics [@Lindblom1965 ch. 5]. Many scientists would prefer that scientists themselves be left out of politics, leaving others to make policy-relevant conclusions based on the knowledge generated by scientific inquiry [@Oliver2006; @Rothman1985]. Analysis, in this perspective, is a favored alternative to politics. On the other hand, the incrementalists point out that a great deal of analysis is itself political, both generated and presented with specific policy goals in mind. The strategic use of analysis is gaining greater attention in fields that traditionally tried to remain apolitical, such as public health [@Oliver2006; @Bernier2011; @Lezine2007; @Navarro2008].

A second important point made by incrementalists is that analysis itself is often limited and subjective. Even the most scientifically rigorous and objective policy analysis must still define a problem and make the case for a particular policy or program as a solution to the problem. For example, some analysts could argue on the basis of their research that restricted access to health care can be solved by making insurance more widely available, while others could argue that cost is the driving factor. Given the conflict between different expert points of view, we would expect people to either mistrust all analysis [@Lindblom1965] or side with experts who share their worldviews [@Zaller1992a]. Incremental models thus posit an important role for policy elites, with the public at a disadvantage and at the mercy of sympathetic elites.

### Punctuated Equilibrium Theory

Punctuated equilibrium theory [PET; see @Jones2005; @True1999], as applied to policy change, also predicts long periods of relatively stable policy. However, this model of the policy process recognizes the potential for significant and sudden departures from the status quo, punctuations that result in a shift to a new equilibrium. Institutions again play an important role in this theory, but the theory also makes an important point about the capacities of both elites and masses to pay attention to an issue. PET assumes, quite reasonably based on past research [@Downs1972], that a nation has a limited amount of attention to devote to any policy issue at any given time. Because of this finite amount of attention, what the public pays attention to matters. When the public does not pay attention to a particular issue, policy elites will generally maintain the status quo. If the public focuses its attention on an issue (often very suddenly), the politics of the issue change dramatically, and policy may also move to a new equilibrium. Proponents of PET say their theory builds in crucial ways on incremental models of policy change, explaining not only the status quo bias of public policy but also the previously anomalous radical departures from the status quo. PET restores some power to the people, in contrast with the incrementalist view of public opinion as highly constrained and Kingdon's observation of public opinion as merely a constraining influence. The public may not be driving policy at all times, but PET posits conditions under which legislative responsiveness is more likely.

### Advocacy Coalition Framework

A fourth model of the policy process, the advocacy coalition framework promoted most prominently by Paul Sabatier [-@Sabatier1988], is based on networks of policy elites and policy makers who work behind the scenes to enact policies. These subsystems, also called advocacy coalitions, have core values and beliefs about the proper course for public policy that develop over time. These developments occur slowly, over a decade or more in most cases, unless an exogenous shock to the system produces rapid change. Core beliefs in the advocacy coalitions change more slowly than peripheral beliefs, and are likely to endure while the peripheral ones are altered to align the core with external circumstances. Even exogenous shocks do not immediately change policy. One example of this dynamic is the changes in attitudes toward the role of public health departments after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the subsequent spate of anthrax-laced envelopes discovered in the postal system. Public health experts, law enforcement officials, and many American citizens were worried about the lack of preparedness to deal with bio-terrorism. However, the long-standing core values of federalism, fear of government abuse of power, and personal and economic freedom impeded full adoption of measures to address the issue [@Gostin2002]. The advocacy coalition framework would predict this resistance to change as a result of the status quo bias within policy subsystems.

In this model, like the incremental model, policy elites impose a constraint on the system, while the public is often viewed as the group agitating for policy change. In this case, the public is constrained by the beliefs of actors in the relevant advocacy coalitions. These elites can essentially control the public dialog and framing of a policy issue, thereby manipulating public opinion at least to some extent, a claim which fits with the findings of other studies [@Jacobs2000; @Zaller1992a; @Druckman2015].

### Implications

The models described in this section illuminate different characteristics of the policy process, including some conflicting views of the relationship between policy and public opinion. The garbage can model suggests that elites are the ones advocating changes, while the public imposes more of a constraining, negative influence. Conversely, both the incremental and advocacy coalition models posit an activist public, frustrated in its wishes by the conservative actions of policy networks. PET, with its emphasis on attention, leaves us agnostic on this issue. When the public pays attention to an issue, significant change can occur. Otherwise, the policy process is dominated by policy elites, which often leads to competition resulting in preservation of the status quo. It would seem from that description that the public is active and the policy community is restrictive. However, the public, realizing that the prevailing equilibrium is no longer acceptable, might suddenly pay attention to a problem that has been created by the previously unnoticed actions of policy elites. Another alternative scenario is that policy elites, hoping to enact some favorable change at the public's expense, inadvertently arouse public opinion in opposition to the proposed change (increased attention need not lead to change, but may also lead to preservation of the status quo). Its lack of micro-level causal explanations leaves PET unable to explain which dynamic is occurring, or whether different issues exhibit different dynamics.

Taking these theories together, we cannot say whether the public or elites lead on policy, but we can start to hypothesize about the conditions under which the public might lead. For one thing, the salience of an issue seems to matter a great deal. Indeed, numerous past studies have found that elected officials are more responsive to public opinion on salient issues (see @Burstein2003 and @Burstein2010 for reviews). It also seems that, in addition to salience, a public that is united in clearly favoring a certain policy is more likely to prevail than one that is divided or indifferent between the policy proposal and the status quo. These characteristics of public opinion itself may have important effects on the responsiveness of policy to public opinion.

The policy process models also indicate that institutions matter, particularly those institutions that link voters to elected officials. If the link is weak, for a specific policy decision or in general, then representation will be less likely. The models further suggest that groups of voters might matter in policy making, whether organized or less formal. Responsiveness to specific groups could affect the representation overall, to the extent that representation can be viewed as a scarce good. In other words, if specific groups of voters compete successfully for a legislator's support, then the median voter will receive less representation than he/ she otherwise would.

For my dissertation, I plan to empirically test the factors mentioned above which might affect legislative responsiveness to public opinion. I will divide the analysis into three chapters, as follows:

1. Political parties provide organization for electoral and legislative politics. @Aldrich2010 and others hypothesize, and preliminary evidence supports the hypothesis [@AldrichForth], that increased party competition in a jurisdiction increases the responsiveness of elected officials individually and governments collectively to public opinion. Party competition may also increase political participation. In chapter 1, I will test these hypotheses.
2. Issue publics, or groups of citizens with more intensely-held opinions about an issue than the rest of the population, may send amplified signals to politicians, causing them to respond more to the issue public than to median public opinion. In previous work, Sunshine Hillygus and I have examined how the number of hunters in a congressional district affects House members' votes on gun bills. In chapter 2 of my dissertation, I plan to use a similar approach to examine the effects of various issue publics on congressional support for health bills. The issue publics analyzed may include doctors, hospitals, the elderly, and the uninsured.
3. In chapter 3, I want to analyze the way characteristics of public opinion itself affects legislative behavior. If we view public opinion itself as a signal received by legislators and translated into policy, then there may be characteristics of the signal itself that affect its reception. My specific hypotheses at this point are as follows (but may change as I do more literature review and consult with advisors): public opinion is expected to exert more consistent influence on representatives' behavior when it clearly favors a change from the status quo, when the variance in opinions is low, when there is more publicly available information about an issue, and when an issue is more salient to the public overall.

These hypotheses rest on theoretical frameworks specific to each topic. For example, there is a whole subfield of political science devoted to the study of political parties and their role in democracy. Therefore, my theoretical framework and specific hypotheses for analyzing parties are developed in chapter 1, separately from the other two chapters. This allows me to tap into the depth of research on this topic, while still maintaining a relevance to the policy process more generally in the context of this dissertation. I intend to write each chapter in such a way that it could stand stand on its own with minimal editing. Before moving into the individual chapters, however, I describe in general terms the concept of representation, which is the main dependent variable in all three chapters, and the measurement issues involved in studying representation.

## Measuring Representation

All three chapters will have the conceptual dependent variable: representation. Measuring representation is of course important to studies like this, but there are many possible measures in the literature from which to choose, each with advantages and limitations. Representation can also be defined at the level of the individual legislator or the entire government (or legislature) in the context of either a single policy or some summary of policy issues. Different ways of conceptualizing representation can also be operationalized for analysis in different ways.

Perhaps the most common way of measuring representation is to use responsiveness, either of the legislator of of the entire legislative body. Responsiveness is essentially correlated movement at the margins. If the public shifts to a more conservative view on an issue, a responsive legislator or legislature will become relatively more supportive of the conservative option. This is measured by correlating estimated legislator ideal points with some measure of voter preferences, perhaps controlling for other factors. Testing representation defined as responsiveness in this manner is the most common approach used in political science to date.

Correspondence is a somewhat different concept, and perhaps a higher standard for representation [@Achen1978; @Griffin2006; @Bafumi2010]. A correspondent legislator or legislature will not simply make marginal movements in line with public opinion, but will actually align itself with the median voter, ideally eliminating any ideological distance between the two. Differences in position require measurement of legislator and constituent preferences on the same ideological scale so a meaningful distance measure can be obtained, a measurement issue which is very difficult to solve. This difficulty is probably the main reason why researchers have not used correspondence measures as much in prior research.

Measures of legislator and constituent preferences/ ideology are extremely important to measures of representation, whether responsiveness or correspondence is used. Legislator ideology is often based on roll call votes. Most studies use ideal point estimates based on parametric scaling of roll call votes, such as the commonly used DW-NOMINATE scores [@Carroll2015, Carroll2009]. However, some have raised important issues with the use of roll call votes in this manner. Not all votes in congress are recorded, and the selection of votes that are recorded is neither random nor exogenous to the outcomes of the votes [@Roberts2007; @Carrubba2008; @Carrubba2006]. Also, there are many reasons a legislator may choose to vote a particular way on a particular bill, some of which are strategic and therefore defy easy classification of a vote as responsive or not [@Krehbiel1993]. A "non-representative" vote on one bill could be meant to secure support from others in the chamber for another bill the legislator or his/ her constituents feel is more important than the first. Is the legislator representing public opinion in this case? The answer is not entirely clear. Thus, roll call votes are an imperfect measure of legislator preferences. Some have suggested cosponsorship activity as an alternative, and some researchers have applied parametric scaling techniques to cosponsorship data to obtain ideal point scores comparable to roll-call based estimates [@Desposato2011; @Aleman2009; @Talbert2002]. Cosponsorship is not a perfect measure either, and is not as closely tied to the passage of policy, but it does provide another opportunity to measure representation.

Some measures that have been used to capture voter preferences include presidential vote share in a legislator's district or state [@Ansolabehere2001], scaling techniques from large surveys or "big data" [@Xing2014], and modeled constituency opinions based on multilevel regression with poststratification [MRP; @Park2004; @Lax2009a; @Lax2009b]. As with the measures of legislator ideology, each of these measures is imperfect.

Presidential vote share is generally easier to collect or access than the other sources mentioned, but it is tied to electoral politics in addition to voter preferences, making it a tainted measure that may also be somewhat endogenous to legislative behavior. The other methods require substantial resources and are generally not available to all researchers or for very long time spans. Survey data that is sufficiently representative of all legislators' constituents is ideal for studying representation on specific policies, even in a correspondence framework, but may not be as useful for overall measures of representation because it is impossible to ask about all or even a significant number of bills a legislature will consider. Survey data that is representative of state-level opinion is becoming somewhat more common, but representative surveys of multiple congressional districts are not conducted. "Big data" is a possible source of representative data in smaller geographic jurisdictions, but generally will not have actual opinion estimates. Instead, demographic and community characteristics can be used to generate preference estimates, even on the same scale as legislator ideal point estimates to yield correspondence measures [@Xing2014]. MRP, which uses multilevel modeling and post-stratification based on demographic information to predict public opinion in small geographic areas, performs well as a measure of public opinion compared to surveys in some cases [@Lax2009a]. Still, these measures are not without limitations. I plan to use as many measures of public opinion as possible in testing my hypotheses in order to increase the robustness of my conclusions.

In summary, there are many different ways to conceptualize and measure representation. Where possible, I intend to use multiple measures to test my hypotheses. I plan to collect available data on cosponsorships and roll calls to use in measuring legislator ideology. I also plan to use not only presidential vote share, but also large-scale surveys like the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), big data [@Xing2014], and estimates from MRP-based studies where possible and appropriate.

Many of the data sources mentioned above and below are common across chapters. To avoid repetition in the chapters, I describe some of the technical details of the various datasets in the data appendix at the end of this prospectus.


# 1. Party Competition and Electoral Accountability

In modern democratic nations, political parties are a common, even universal institutional feature of government. Political scientists have argued for decades that democracy is "unthinkable" [@Schattschneider1942] or "unworkable" [@Aldrich2011; @Aldrich2010] without parties. Parties, these scholars claim, are an important mechanism through which voters can hold their elected representatives accountable, a key feature of democratic government. However, the ideal of responsible party government, in which strong, ideologically distinct parties compete for votes on a national scale for extended periods of time, has not been realized in many portions of American history. During a period of almost uninterrupted Democratic control of Congress from the 1950s through 1995, the strength of America's two major political parties was thought by many observers to be in decline [@Wattenberg1990; @Aldrich2011], and electoral accountability seemed to have disappeared as a result [@Fiorina1980]. At least part of this decline in accountability is attributable to the inability of the Republican Party to compete meaningfully in the "Solid South," which effectively functioned as a one-party system during this era. Since 1980, however, as the Republican Party has made significant inroads in the South, the responsiveness of members of Congress to public opinion has increased significantly in that region [@AldrichForth], in turn making Congress more responsive overall. In short, scholars argue that without strong parties, citizens may not have any way to hold elected officials accountable for their actions, and those elected officials will have less incentive and ability to listen to their constituents.

How have changes in party competition affected electoral accountability and responsiveness to public opinion in the US? @AldrichForth provides initial evidence that responsiveness has increased along with party competition since the 1980s. In this chapter, I propose to conduct further tests of this hypothesis. In addition, I will take this analysis a step further by examining whether the policies (specifically, adopted bills) that emerge during periods of greater party competition are more representative of preferences overall. I expect to find that increased party competition does indeed lead to increased responsiveness to public opinion, both at the level of the individual legislator and at the aggregate level, as well as increased mass participation in politics. By empirically supporting this link between political institutions and electoral accountability, this research will increase our understanding of the role political parties play in democratic government. Despite over a century of scholarship on parties [@Ranney1975; @Epstein1986], we are just now beginning to make this link [@Aldrich2010], and further empirical testing is in order. The tests I perform will also yield potential avenues for reform of political parties to achieve more desirable policy outcomes.

## Background

Political parties are institutions that organize both electoral and legislative politics. Political parties are most often viewed as a creation of elite politicians as aids in the realization of their personal political goals [@Aldrich2011]. One fundamental goal of politicians in a democracy is to win election to government office [@Mayhew1974; @Fenno1973]. This is not necessarily their only goal, however, as those who seek office generally seek it as a means to some end, rather than as an end in itself [@Aldrich2001]. Thus, parties serve not merely as vehicles for winning election and ensuring reelection through enactment of party platforms, but also as ongoing purveyors of specific policy goals. In these roles, parties attract benefit-seeking activists in addition to candidates [@Aldrich1983], and it is these activists who provide much of the resources and support for the party's candidates [@Aldrich2011; @Aldrich2010]. The set of all parties in a given nation comprise the party system, a key institutional feature of both electoral and legislative politics.

In legislative bodies like the US Congress, parties provide structure to the legislative process beyond that prescribed by formal constitutional institutions. Parties also provide great flexibility for groups of legislators to change the way legislative business is conducted from time to time, depending on the needs and circumstances of the party. However, this flexibility also means that the majority party will not always govern as a cohesive unit enacting an ideologically coherent platform and overruling the minority party's opinion. According to the conditional party government model [CPG; see @Aldrich2001], legislative parties will act cohesively when there is more ideological consistency within the party (especially the majority) and less overlap across parties. During the decades of Democratic control of Congress, it was not until around 1980 that Democrats began to "rule" in any meaningful sense, following significant reforms within the majority party that took power from the committee chairs (mostly Southern conservatives) and gave it to chamber leaders who would be more in tune with the views of more orthodox liberal Democrats [@Rohde1991; @Aldrich2001]. According to CPG, this occurred because the Democratic party became more consistently liberal, Republicans more consistently conservative, and the level of overlap and cooperation between the two decreased.

While parties are created by elites to serve elite purposes, they may also provide for political accountability of elected officials to the voters, an important element of any functioning democracy. The strongest institutional hold citizens have on governing parties is the vote. However, the act of voting has multiple purposes, and therefore may be a somewhat ambiguous signal for politicians. On one hand is the prospective or mandate model of voting, in which voters give their votes to the candidate who espouses their most preferred policy platform, and the winning candidate is elected with the understanding that he/ she will proceed to enact the platform on which he/ she ran. Many influential theories of representation, such as the median voter model [@Downs1957], are based on this concept of voting. This model preserves the meaningfulness of substantive policy proposals in campaigns, but does not provide for any enforcement of the electoral mandate once the candidate is installed in office [@Manin1999]. On the other hand is the retrospective or accountability model of voting, which posits that voters will vote for the incumbents if they have performed well in office or if good conditions around election time are attributed to the incumbents. If conditions are bad and voters think the incumbent government is to blame, they will vote for the challengers and "throw the rascals out" [@Stokes1996; @Manin1999]. While this model induces representation when the public has complete information, it fails to do so when information is less complete. @Manin1999 suggest that voters may actually use their votes in both ways, and that it is rational to do so, but with the result that governments may be somewhat less accountable when such dual-purpose voting is employed. Thus, we might expect parties to be somewhat responsive to the public, but not completely so. Other institutions affect the level of accountability a governing party faces in future elections.

There is a long-running debate in political science on the marginality hypothesis, which essentially states that elected officials are more responsive to public opinion when elections are competitive. The debate has produced a large body of work both supporting [@Ansolabehere2001; @Griffin2006] and refuting [@Fiorina1973; @Gerber1995; @Groseclose2001] this prediction. However, as @Aldrich2010 point out, studies along these lines do not generally measure *party* competition. Incumbent candidates in one-party systems may occasionally face strong challengers, and intra-party factional struggles may break out temporarily, but the incumbent party will not face any strong competition. This is important because the retrospective voting (voting based on the incumbent party's record in office) on which electoral accountability is often based in theory [@Downs1957; @Manin1999; @Aldrich2010] requires a strong alternative party that can serve as a real choice for dissatisfied voters. Individual politicians and non-partisan factions do not face the same incentives parties face, because they do not recruit candidates and have no need to cultivate an inclusive group brand that is favorable to a majority of voters across both time and place. These non-partisan actors, therefore, will not be as sensitive to electoral pressures as parties.

What the marginality studies have been missing is the fact that accountability comes not from electoral competition in general, but rather from competition between parties in particular. Individual elected officials, therefore, will be more accountable to voters when the party brand with which they have chosen to affiliate is challenged by a candidate with a somewhat equally competitive and significantly different party brand that offers voters a real choice. In an election in which this condition obtains, we might expect representatives ultimately elected and reelected under these conditions to be more responsive to public opinion.

It is not as clear from the outset that greater party competition will lead to greater policy responsiveness on the whole. For a party to compete meaningfully in a given election, it must field strong candidates who have a real chance of winning. This means candidates so fielded must be sensitive to what the voters want from their candidates. However, the party also needs to present a clear choice to voters in order for the party label to have any meaning. Parties need to be sufficiently distinct from each other in order to convey meaningful information to the voters. This tension might also be thought of as a tension between a party's "establishment" leaders, who want to win elections and seek to recruit candidates who can win, and the activist wing of a party, which is more concerned with keeping the party's brand "pure" and making sure candidates and elected officials don't betray the party platform. Without the activists, parties would nominate candidates they thought would win, and parties would essentially converge on the median voter in each district [as predicted by @Downs1957], become ideologically spread out across the country given ideological differences across districts, and cease to provide meaningful information about any particular candidate's ideological views. In the long run, party competition in any meaningful sense would break down. Parties would compete in every district, but would not compete as parties with any clear agenda or platform. On the other hand, without the establishment, activists would only nominate their ideological favorites, leading to national convergence of elected officials to the two party medians [as set by the activists, see @Aldrich1983 for a description of these dynamics], but no district-level convergence on the district medians. This would result in very distinct parties, but ones that are not competitive in any but a few districts in the ideological center of the country. Once again, party competition breaks down, as parties do not compete meaningfully in most districts. The ongoing struggle between the establishment and the activists, however, leaves some middle ground for parties to be electorally competitive in more districts, but also to preserve their distinct ideological positions. This dynamic allows for more individual responsiveness through the dynamics of party competition described above. Based on the CPG model, it also provides better conditions for maintenance of cohesive parties and therefore greater responsiveness of governments in general.

*[The idea in the preceding paragraph needs to be explored more thoroughly, either through existing literature or through my own theoretical development. I will be looking into this more thoroughly over the next few months.]*

Some of this responsiveness may come as a result of changes in party control of the government, rather than changes in the public views and behavior of individual representatives. Past research has shown that legislators tend to "die with their ideological boots on", and that overall ideological change in policy happens more through replacement of old legislators with new, more representative ones than through conversion or evolution of legislator views and behaviors [@Poole1997; @Poole2007]. This explains the recently observed pattern of "leap-frog representation," whereby the ideal points of a district's representatives change wildly about a district median that does not change as much, but enough to defeat an incumbent in favor of the other party's candidate [@Bafumi2010]. Still, there are some factors that may lead individual members of Congress to be more (or less) responsive. As summarized by @Ensley2013, four such factors include redistricting [@Crespin2010], seniority in office [@Stratmann2000; @Ensley2009; @Burden2004], competitive electoral processes [@Ansolabehere2001], and impending retirement [@Rothenberg2000]. Changes in constituent preferences also leads to changes in individual legislator behavior in some studies [for example, @Ansolabehere2001; @Burden2004; @Griffin2006]. Whether through replacement or changes within individual legislators, party competition can lead to greater responsiveness.

In addition to increasing responsiveness, we might also expect party competition to increase mass participation in electoral politics. Competitive elections in general tend to increase participation [@Cox1989; @Patterson1983; @Caldeira1985]. Parties and other political organizations can make voting easier by lowering information costs and opportunity costs of participation [@Huckfeldt1992; @Rosenstone1993; @Wielhouwer2003]. However, such changes in participation might not be recognized equally across all classes of voters. Parties have incentives to mobilize only certain kinds of voters, particularly those who will support their candidates [@Goldstein2010]. @Patterson1984 find that competitive state and local parties are associated with stronger activist networks in those jurisdictions. Still, we might expect higher participation on the margins in districts characterized by party competition. When both parties have incentives to mobilize (to fend off electoral threats from the other party), then they will both reach out to at least their bases. This would not occur in a less competitive area in which one party was assured of victory and therefore had no need to mobilize.

## Data and Planned Analysis

To test these hypotheses, I will construct measures of party competitiveness at the state and congressional district level using election returns from as many federal, state, and local (partisan) elections as I can. I will average all of the major party election results over a reasonable time span leading up to and including a particular election. Alternative specifications of this measure could exclude the elections in which the member of Congress for whom the measure is constructed are directly involved. For example, I could exclude the election returns for the Alaska at-large House elections in measuring the level of party competition candidates running for that seat would expect to face. I could also experiment with using multiple regression to calculate the party competition measure, which would allow me to control for incumbency, redistricting, and other factors. For competition measures in House districts, I will certainly need to think about and control for the effects of redistricting somehow. In addition to party competition measures based on election returns, a possible alternative specification could employ measures of funding or other support from national and state party committees (perhaps including leadership PACs).

I will use the competition measure(s) to predict representative behaviors, including roll call voting and cosponsorship. I will also control for public opinion in some form, probably using polling data, ideal point estimates from my Catalist data, and presidential vote share in the district[^1] in various alternative specifications.

To test the hypothesis about individual legislator responsiveness, I will use the independent variables mentioned above at the state and district level (for House and Senate respectively) to predict individual legislative behaviors. If party competition interacts with the public opinion measure in such a way that responsiveness to public opinion is increased as party competition increases, I will count that as support for the hypothesis. I will perform this in a multiple regression context, using logit models for binary dependent variables and OLS for scaled overall ideology scores. In tests using polling data as the public opinion measure, I will restrict the analysis to voting and cosponsorship of bills related to the issue for which opinion data is available.[^2]

Testing the hypothesis about responsiveness of the legislature as a whole will require some aggregation of party competition and public opinion measures, probably an average of district/ state averages. Rather than individual legislative behavior, I will predict actions taken by the legislature as a whole. The most obvious of these is whether or not a bill was passed (regardless of whether it was signed by the President). Other possible dependent variables could be budget appropriations, introduction of certain types of bills, and committee hearings on a topic. I could also test for differences in the responsiveness of the two chambers separately, which might be an interesting qualitative look at the effects of legislative institutions on representation. Depending on how much data I have available, I may only be able to provide descriptive statistics related to this hypothesis.


# 2. Issue Publics in Health Policy

For almost a century, the politics of health policy in America has been characterized by the "negative consensus" that something should be done to fix or improve America's health care system.[^3] This consensus has been shared by elites and masses alike. However, there is much less agreement on exactly how the health system should be fixed. Health policy in America is characterized by multiple competing interests. Payer interests, mostly embodied in a large private health insurance industry, want low prices for health services. In recent years, the public sector has become a major player in the payer environment as well with the rise of Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs. Providers, who have long been wary of oversight by outside groups and institutions, have at various times fiercely resisted the encroachment of the payers on their professional autonomy. Patients and consumers want access to quality health care services and products, which often also leads them to be concerned about costs being shifted onto them. Other groups, such as the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, medical research and education programs, and even employers who often pay for health coverage for their employees also have vested interests in health policy. This complex tapestry of competing interests, combined with the negative consensus and the lack of any centralized control over the health care system, makes health policy in America a perennial high-profile political issue. This issue area is also a perfect case study of the effects of groups on representation.

The study of group effects on representation, as explained in more detail below, often looks at the effects of *organized* groups on legislators and legislatures. These groups, theory predicts, affect legislative behavior by lobbying candidates and elected officials and seeking support in exchange for information and campaign support in the form of donations and other political action. Organized interests have been shown, at least in some cases, to exert significant influence on policy. However, organized interest groups are not the only manifestation of group politics in America. The public opinion literature on issue publics suggests that unorganized groups may also have an influence on policy, though neither public opinion scholars nor legislative scholars have tested this link directly. Building on my ongoing research with Sunshine Hillygus, I propose to test the hypothesis that unorganized groups of voters can affect legislative behavior independent of organized interests, thus affecting the responsiveness of legislators to public opinion overall.

## Background[^4]

Given prior research on legislator behavior, there is little doubt that party matters. Partisan polarization has been a defining feature of American politics in recent decades. Research shows the two major political parties have come to take predictable and opposing ideological positions on many major issues [@Cox2005; @Roberts2003; @Rohde1991; @Petrocik1987; @Shafer2006; @Adams2008; @Brady2007; @Burden2001; @Burden2004; @Levendusky2009a]. Across a range of studies, from those examining roll call-based ideal points [@Poole1997; @Poole2001] to analyses of electoral patterns [@Jacobson2003], it is clear that political elites are polarized [see also @Hetherington2009]. One potential implication of this literature is that legislative voting behavior should simply follow party lines, as with some recent prominent legislation such as the Affordable Care Act and numerous attempts to repeal it, or the Paycheck Fairness Act of 2014. Many issues, including major health care reform, are often cast in partisan terms. The ACA is one clear and prominent example of this schism in Congress. The bill was passed without a single Republican vote in favor. Since its passage, House Republicans have tried repeatedly to repeal it, and Republican congressional and presidential candidates have made repealing and replacing the ACA a major message of their campaigns. Democrats still largely favor the reform bill, providing a stark partisan contrast. This polarization certainly provides a clear choice for voters on Election Day, an important feature of party competition that strengthens accountability.

However, not all votes in Congress are partisan. The ACA is more of an exception than the rule in this regard. This may partly be a result of using roll call votes, the instigation of which is endogenous to partisan politics in the chamber, as a measure of legislative behavior. Still, there are numerous instances of Democrats and Republicans "crossing the aisle" to vote for the other party's bills, and of members of Congress "working across the aisle" on legislation both parties find desirable. Perhaps this bipartisanship has decreased in recent years as polarization has increased, but it has by no means disappeared completely from Congress, especially on less high-profile bills. Partisanship still matters in predicting votes, but it is not the whole story.

Within the congressional literature, the prominent counter to the party power hypothesis is that district preferences, not party control, determines voting behavior [@Krehbiel1993]. The classic median voter theorem predicts that members of Congress will take positions (in this case, vote) according to the preferences of the median voters in their districts [@Downs1957; @Davis1970]. If legislators represent their constituents in this manner, then legislator votes will correspond to their median voter's preferences. Assuming that ideology is unidimensional, the representative simply picks the median voter's position to ensure reelection. This is the classic notion of democratic representation.

However, previous empirical studies do not always fit well with the assumptions of the median voter model. For example, rather than viewing constituents as a spectrum, members of Congress might see groups of voters, each with different but not necessarily contradictory demands of their elected officials [@Kingdon1995]. Fenno's [-@Fenno1977] classic study of House members in their constituencies uncovered a great deal of heterogeneity in representatives' perceptions of their constituents. Constituents matter, but not always in the manner the median voter theorem predicts, and there are few explanations for these nuances offered in the congressional literature [@Theriault2011].

The observed deviations from the median voter theorem seem to suggest that groups matter. Often, this is modeled as organized interest groups affecting congressional behavior. It is straightforward to come up with a theoretical mechanism for such influence. Research shows that members of Congress are held accountable for their votes on particular issues, such as crime policy [@Bonney2007; @CanesWrone2011], depending on their level of salience at the time of the roll call and regardless of the legislator's voting record overall. Interest groups may play a key role in this dynamic, through their lobbying and campaign finance activities. As interest groups monitor elected officials, they may then try to use their influence to reward (punish) members of Congress who support (oppose) the group's position. Regarding gun policy, @Shaiko1998 document the ability of the National Rifle Association (NRA) to mobilize both its official membership and the larger gun rights community and cite that grassroots mobilization as the reason for the NRA's success in influencing elections and policy. On the other side of the issue, gun control groups have made some strides in organizing themselves effectively, though that process has been a long one @Lambert1998. Theoretically, interest groups may therefore affect roll call votes in Congress.

Whether interest group influence is always manifested is harder to discern from the literature, which contains mixed results on the effects of interest group contributions and lobbying efforts [@Smith1995; @Theriault2011]. Still, there is some evidence that interest groups affect roll call voting at least sometimes on some issues. In an analysis of roll call voting and dairy industry contributions in the mid-1970's, @Welch1982 finds that interest group contributions affected legislator voting behavior, though not as much as other factors like partisanship or the size of the dairy industry in the legislator's district. On gun bills specifically, @Langbein1993 report that NRA contributions are more effective at intensifying support from legislators already committed to pro-gun policies, rather than convincing legislators to change their minds. However, the same study finds that gun control groups were not as successful in any regard in their use of campaign contributions. Sunshine Hillygus and I find similar results when analyzing the effects of gun-related interest group contributions on roll call votes.

Group influence on members of Congress may not occur solely through organized interests. Identifiable but unorganized groups of voters that tend to vote a certain way based on certain issues may also have an effect, independent of any financial or other organized activity, and not in quite the same way as the median voter theorem predicts. Within the public opinion literature, there is recognition that not all individuals care equally about all issues. According to the issue public perspective, voters might not have a coherent set of ideologies on which they base their vote preferences, but they are often knowledgeable or engaged on an issue or two based on self-interest, group identification, and/ or strong personal values [@Krosnick1990]. The notion of issue publics has long played an important role in explaining public opinion and political behavior, but has largely been ignored in the Congressional voting literature. Instead, that literature has largely equated passion surrounding an issue with interest groups, with campaign contributions from these groups as the measurable manifestation of attempts to influence legislative behavior. However, organized groups may be elite-driven, only nominally representing the views of those they claim to represent [@Skocpol2001; @Skocpol2003]. They may also fail to include significant portions of the relevant population. For example, in 2012 only 24 percent of gun owners were members of the NRA, and support for gun control policies was higher among gun owners who did not belong to the NRA [@Sides2012]. Throughout its history, the American Medical Association has at times been reined in by constituent doctors for being unrepresentative of their opinions [@Starr1982]. This incongruence between interest groups and issue publics suggests that whether or not interest groups have any effect on roll call voting, the issue publics may have distinct effects of their own. Most importantly, issue publics might not be organized at all – the assumption is simply that they are individuals who are more likely to vote on the basis of this policy area. The distinction between interest groups and issue publics is fundamentally about assumed mechanisms of representation – votes versus money.

My hypotheses regarding interest groups and issue publics have been tentatively supported in previous work with Sunshine Hillygus. In that study, we analyzed the effects of issue publics and interest group contributions on two gun-related bills. We used hunters as our issue public, and campaign contributions from both gun rights groups (like the NRA) and gun control groups as our interest group measures. We found significant effects of both, even when controlling for partisanship and district preferences. However, there is work still to be done in establishing issue publics as a factor affecting representation. The votes we analyzed were not close votes, thereby not allowing us to rule out the possibility of greater party control on votes the majority party may actually lose. We also only analyze one issue public (hunters) and one issue (gun policy). To further support the claim that issue publics affect representation, we need to test more groups and more issues. I will provide such tests in this chapter, focusing on health policy bills and at least five health-related issue publics: doctors, hospitals, seniors, Medicaid recipients, and the uninsured. Other issue publics could easily be added to this analysis, subject to data availability.

## Data

### Bills

One of the advantages of focusing on health policy (rather than a more narrow issue like gun control) is the larger number of roll call votes and bills in Congress on the subject. In my analysis, I plan to analyze voting behavior on all roll call votes (whether for amendments or final passage of bills) categorized by the Policy Agendas Project[^5] as health related (major topic code 3). Thus, roll call votes will serve as the main dependent variable of my analysis. I will examine votes taken in both the House and the Senate, and hopefully there will be variation in how close the margin of victory or defeat is. This will allow me to specifically examine the implications of different strategic contexts for representation of issue publics (and of the public in general).

As mentioned in the introduction to this prospectus, there are important issues in the use of roll call votes as measures of legislator ideology. To mitigate these concerns, I will also collect data on cosponsorship decisions for health-related bills and use that as an alternative dependent variable. This will allow me to show any qualitative similarities across specifications of the dependent variable, increasing confidence in the overall findings.

### Issue Publics

As mentioned previously, I will analyze the effectiveness of five potential health-related issue publics: doctors, hospitals, the uninsured, the elderly, and Medicaid recipients. This list presents a wide array of groups, and will allow for some comparison of the responsiveness of members of Congress to each of these groups. Some may be more effective at getting their way than others, and although the tests I will present in this paper will not be able to directly explore these differences in effectiveness, prior research on these groups can be brought to bear in explaining the results. I also expect certain groups to be more represented on specific subtopics. For example, doctors may illicit more responsiveness on provider-specific bills (which can be identified using Policy Agendas Project subtopic/ minor codes). At any rate, having data on multiple potential issue publics will be advantageous in testing the issue public representation hypothesis.

The general strategy for measuring issue public strength is to obtain some estimate of the number of people belonging to a specific group (i.e. Medicaid recipients) in a member of Congress' constituency (states for Senators, districts for House members). For doctors, I obtained practice data on all providers who billed Medicare in 2012. Using practice address, I geocoded this data and merged it with a congressional district map, thus linking all matched providers to a state and a congressional district.[^6] The assumption that providers affect the votes of the member of Congress in whose district they *practice* (as opposed to district of residence) is defensible for two reasons. First, it is plausible to assume that doctors live close to their practices. In some urban/ geographically small districts, this may be somewhat more problematic, but controlling for population density should help with this unfortunate measurement error. Second, even if a doctor does not live in a congressional district, it is likely that both members of Congress and their actual constituents will be  familiar with businesses in their districts, including doctors' offices. Members of Congress may want to keep economic actors in their districts happy, and doctors have at times been known to transmit messages on policy to their patients/ customers [@Starr1982]. Thus, although the use of practice address is imprecise, it is likely to still provide a sufficient measure of issue public strength, one that will do well at representing the signals actually received by members of Congress.

For the uninsured, elderly (specifically, Medicare beneficiaries), and Medicaid recipients, data can potentially be collected from a number of sources. Estimates of the first two at least are available from Catalist. Estimates of all three might be available from Census Bureau sources, particularly the Bureau's Small Area Health Insurance Estimates data. The states may report data on Medicaid recipients. If actual (or estimated) enrollments in the public payers cannot be obtained, I could use demographic data, such as age and income, estimate the enrollment rates. Another option is to try to find data on Medicare/ Medicaid funding going to a state or district. Perhaps measures of charity care provided in an area could proxy for the uninsured, though the adequacy of this proxy is certainly debatable.

Hospitals are obviously a different kind of issue public, in that they are organizations, not people, and certainly not voters. However, I still plan to analyze the effect the number of hospitals in a state/ district has on legislative behavior because, as with doctors, the existence of hospitals, which tend to be very visible features of a community, in a district may be something members of Congress pay attention to. To the extent legislators pay attention to hospitals rather than voters, hospitals may be thought of as a "quasi-issue public." Self-interest can certainly give rise to issue publics defined strictly as groups of individuals, and it is worth testing whether the same dynamic occurs for organizations in ways other than their official industry advocacy groups. I will look into obtaining hospital data from a government agency (CMS, HHS, or CDC) or from an industry group like the American Hospital Association.

I am not certain I can obtain data on other issue publics to include in this analysis, but I will consider including groups like cancer patients, nurses and other health care providers, etc. if I can obtain geographic data on these groups. I am open to any suggestions or tips along these lines.
	
### Campaign Finance

To control for the activities of organized interest groups, hypothesized to be distinct from unorganized issue publics, I will obtain campaign finance data from interest groups that might be thought to represent the issue publics mentioned, as well as some other groups. For example, the American Medical Association and other provider groups contribute heavily to political campaigns, and may be thought of as an organized analog to doctors in general. Campaign finance data by industry/ issue is available from the Center for Responsive Politics' website, opensecrets.org. Specifically, I will collect data on donations from health care provider groups such as the AMA, hospital groups like the American Hospital Association, other health industry groups such as those that represent insurance and pharmaceutical companies, Medicare/ senior groups like the AARP, advocacy groups for the poor and uninsured, and patient/ disease-specific advocacy groups.

### Public Opinion

Public opinion will be measured in my analyses using a few different sources. The Catalist ideal point data described in the data appendix will probably be the main measure. However, this data has the limitation of being applicable to only a few Congresses. I could supplement this with data from large surveys (CCES and NAES), but this again is limited in terms of the number of Congresses it can be applied to. Presidential vote share in a state/ district, despite its issues as a measure of public opinion, does allow for a somewhat longer time span for analysis. I will attempt to draw general qualitative conclusions based on all these sources of data, noting that each has its own limitations.

### Other Data

Information on the partisan affiliations of members of Congress is obviously necessary, and will be collected for this analysis. In addition, there are likely to be district- or state-level variables that should be included as controls. These might include population density or some other measure of urbanicity, region of the country, income levels and racial distributions the district or state, and others. Again, I am open to suggestions on control variables, and I will look at past research to see what controls have been employed in studies of health politics.

## Planned Analysis

To test my hypotheses regarding issue publics, I will use the size of an issue public in a state/ district to predict legislator support for health-related bills, controlling for median state/ district opinion, campaign contributions from organized health groups, and legislator partisanship. If the size of an issue public has an independent correlation with the dependent variable, issue public influence is occurring. A further test of the hypothesis involves interaction terms between issue public size and public opinion. If the size of an issue public changes the relationship between public preferences and legislative behavior, then the issue public is affecting the representational relationship.

I propose to examine the effects of issue publics on legislatures in two ways. First, I can examine how many votes on each bill are influenced by issue publics, using the results of the analyses described above. If enough votes are influenced, it could change the fate of a particular bill. Second, I can examine the relationship between the size of the issue public nationally and legislative behavior. In this analysis, I could control not only for campaign contributions, but also for lobbying expenditures by relevant groups.


# 3. Characteristics of Public Opinion

In democratic theory, public opinion is often seen as a prime mover of policy, but public opinion in reality is not always directly translated into policy. It seems, however, that certain characteristics of public opinion might influence policy makers to pay more attention to the public, at least on some issues. If we think of public opinion as a signal, then we might expect the nature of the signal itself to affect its reception. Politicians may not receive or be unable to interpret noisy signals from the public, and may even exploit such opportunities to act more independently. In discussing public opinion as a signal, it will be useful to discuss a few relevant characteristics individually, namely valence, stability, and salience. Other classifications or terms may be better suited for other purposes, and this list is not necessarily exhaustive of all the characteristics of public opinion, but these four characteristics are each relevant to representation of public opinion.

## Valence

Valence refers to directionality, and is probably what most people have in mind when they talk about "public opinion." The public may favor one policy or one elected official over another. Alternatively, the public may approve or disapprove of a policy maker, policymaking body, or specific policy. Whether considered in unidimensional or multidimensional terms, we can speak of public opinion taking (or failing to take) a certain valence, or position regarding the opinion object.

If the public generally agrees on a clear departure from the status quo, then the valence of public opinion is quite clear. In these cases, politicians will generally receive a strong signal that they should act in a certain way. However, if aggregate public opinion on an issue takes a more moderate valence, then the signals politicians receive become more ambiguous. A moderate valence can be produced either by many people holding truly moderate opinions or by sizable, relatively equally sized groups having opinions at both extremes. The latter case fits the definition of polarization, a subject of considerable debate in political science.

There is very little argument over the reality of elite polarization, but scholars disagree on whether the public has become similarly divided. Some claim that the public is divided "closely," not "deeply," meaning most people hold politically moderate views and thus are not truly polarized [@Fiorina2006; @Fiorina2008]. However, evidence of increasingly extreme opinions in the ideological wings of both major parties and increasing social cleavages leads other scholars to describe the public as quite polarized [@Abramowitz2008].

The picture of mass polarization becomes even more complicated when ambivalence and multidimensionality are thrown into the mix. Prominent public opinion research shows that people are often not genuinely moderate in their opinions, but hold competing considerations on particular issues [@Zaller1992a; @Zaller1992b; @Hochschild1981]. This means the public could be induced to support either side of a policy debate if politicians seek to sway public opinion through "crafted talk" [@Jacobs2000]. In addition, the public does not seem to adhere to a strictly unidimensional ideology [@Treier2009], and may even be completely "innocent of ideology" [@Converse1964]. Other evidence suggests that non-elite citizens tend to "morselize" their views on issues, thinking about issues in distinct ways that do not necessarily apply the same considerations or ways of thinking consistently [@Kinder1983; @Lane1962]. Thus, we cannot necessarily speak of aggregate moderation as people genuinely taking a moderate position, when perhaps the moderation is only an overall average of ambivalent individual-level opinions.

The debate over polarization, the existence of multiple unrelated dimensions in public opinion, and simultaneous support for competing considerations makes a complete and accurate assessment of the valence of public opinion very difficult, highlighting the noisiness of signals being sent to policy makers. Political scientists and others will continue to examine the microfoundations of public opinion in an attempt to settle the polarization question, but politicians are unlikely to conduct such thorough analysis. Kingdon reports claims by policy makers themselves that they are able to sense public opinion, at least roughly [@Kingdon1995], but this is only an ability to discern valence at a very high level, without much nuance or sophistication. Later models of party identification also suggest that partisanship is based on evaluations of the various political parties [@Fiorina1984; @Johnston2006], implying that an aggregate measure of partisanship might provide useful signals of public opinion at a very general level [@MacKuen1989]. However, neither partisanship nor elites' gut-level sense of public opinion can fully capture the valence of public opinion on every issue. There is thus no reason to think politicians understand or generally care why public opinion takes the valence they perceive. Politicians are therefore receiving noisy signals from the public, rendering them less likely and less able to respond directly to public opinion when aggregate public opinion is moderate and especially when it is moderate and polarized.

Analytically, we can define moderation as being in favor of the status quo. When the valence of public opinion is strongly in favor of a shift from the status quo, politicians will be more likely to go along with that because such a clear signal has electoral implications. If, however, public opinion is polarized in such a way that half favor a significant shift from the status quo in one direction, while the other half favor a significant shift in the opposite direction, elected officials will be less responsive to aggregate public opinion in setting policy. The aggregate in this latter case is moderate on average, but politicians can pick one side and still say they are representing "the public." Which side they choose will depend on other factors, but we can still hypothesize on a first order that opinion in favor of the status quo on average but with high variance will elicit less representative actions from elected officials.

## Stability

Stability, another characteristic of public opinion, refers to the processes by which opinion changes or does not change. In talking about stability, I mean not only whether public opinion changes or not, but also how it changes. Does public opinion follow a path of only minor, incremental changes, or does it tend to fluctuate wildly from one extreme to another? Does it change predictably, or is the change random and unpredictable? As with valence, the stability of public opinion affects the clarity of the signals public officials receive from the public. In addition, stability or lack thereof has implications for the mobilization and malleability of public opinion.

Various theories of public opinion yield different conclusions regarding stability. The classic view of "crystallized opinions" essentially models public opinion as an aggregation of stable, preexisting mental constructs in each individual's mind, as reported to a pollster [@Converse1964; @Kinder1983; @Kinder1998]. When a person is asked his/ her opinion of the president or the death penalty or the state of the health care system, he/ she retrieves the relevant opinion construct from memory and reports its value to the pollster. One implication of the crystallized opinions model, along with the cognitive constraints of the human mind, is that opinions on one issue will be correlated with opinions on other issues [@Kinder1983]. Ideological constraint, based on the ideological frameworks given by political elites, help people know "what goes with what," as @Converse1964 puts it. This kind of stability in opinions would make for very strong signals from the people to their elected officials.

In 1964, Philip Converse published a withering critique of the crystallized opinions model, based on evidence of significant instability in public opinion [see also @Kinder1983]. Converse found that most Americans were not ideologically constrained in their political beliefs. Their opinions on one issue did not correspond with opinions on other issues. Converse also found that attitudes were highly unstable over time, and not in ways that would indicate any kind of constraint or crystallized attitude. Converse concludes that the public holds no stable "crystallized opinions," but rather relies on group memberships and imperfect understandings of the issues. This means that instead of stable, clear signals, politicians are getting only meaningless noise from public opinion.

Converse's [-@Converse1964] powerful critique of the crystallized attitudes model left public opinion scholars deeply divided over the issue of whether attitudes can be treated as preexisting constructs or not. The memory-based model, which John Zaller also calls the Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) model [@Zaller1992a; @Zaller1992b], attempts to explain the observed instability and inconsistency of public opinion. When citizens receive a message, they choose whether or not to accept that message. If accepted, the information becomes a "consideration," and is placed in memory for later use. Considerations are stored in a sort of mental pile, with more recently processed considerations on top of the pile being more accessible. When asked a question, a person conducts a quick search of his/ her mental pile for relevant considerations. This search has a stochastic element, but is also affected by the relative accessibility of considerations in memory. This is generally a very quick process, with cognitive effort kept to a minimum. The person does not go digging through the pile looking for considerations that satisfy some minimum criterion of relevance, but rather picks a few easily accessible considerations from the top of the pile that look most relevant. If relevant considerations are successfully located, the respondent averages across those considerations and gives a response accordingly.

The memory-based model predicts unstable public opinion, based partly on stochastic processes, but this version of public opinion is not as unstable as the version put forth by Converse and others. Zaller identifies some predictable elements to public opinion, based on the information environment in which voters operate. The RAS model's predictions about opinion change indicate that there is at least some meaning behind public opinion as measured by polls and other methods. Perhaps politicians, being familiar as they are with the political information environment (indeed, they create much of this information), really can have some sense of public opinion in the manner @Kingdon1995 describes. Still, according to the memory-based model, there is a lot of noise in the signals politicians receive from the public.

Another class of public opinion theories is based on the online model of cognitive processing [@Hastie1986; @Lodge1989; @Taber2006]. According to these models, opinion constructs are updated each time new information related to the opinion object is encountered. Later iterations of this model have added motivated reasoning, in which the prior value of the tally affects how the new information is incorporated. For example, if a voter already dislikes Bill Clinton, then she will be more likely to view information about the Monica Lewinsky scandal as a reason to dislike him more, whereas a person with a more favorable prior attitude toward Bill Clinton might be prone to say the scandal does not really matter. This model implies that opinions will be relatively stable, though changes in response to information can occur. @Zaller1992a argues that the online model is simply a more modern version of the crystallized attitudes model.

Despite the conflicting mechanisms and conclusions of the different models, most public opinion scholars agree that information matters in public opinion, especially in terms of its stability. If citizens have information, they can give opinions that are at least more stable than they otherwise would be. Even in the online model, a lack of information could cause the running tallies of uninformed voters to easily swing from one valence to another. When citizens have appropriate information and can use it well, signals are strong. This brings up a couple of important questions. Do citizens have the information necessary for an informed public opinion, and do they know how to use the information they do have?

The answer to the first question is generally "no." Americans in particular fare quite poorly on tests of political knowledge [@DelliCarpini1996; @Kinder1998]. However, there is still a possibility that voters can leverage certain pieces of information in making rational political assessments, leading to stable and predictable public opinion despite the public's relative ignorance. Perhaps people can use simple cues as heuristics or shortcuts that allow them to reach the same conclusion they would make if fully informed. For example, relatively uninformed voters who knew the position of the insurance industry on a series of 1988 California ballot initiatives voted about the same way in the aggregate as better informed voters [@Lupia1994]. However, other research suggests the use of heuristics is not generally a satisfactory substitute for full information, and that less sophisticated voters often employ heuristics ineffectively or even incorrectly [@Kuklinski2000; @Kinder1998; @Lau2001]. More recent models of the policy process have either used assumptions that do not require fully informed voters [@Soroka2010] or explicitly assume that voters are not well-informed about all issues at all times [@Jones2005; @True1999].

Stability in public opinion and voting behavior can come from group identities, such as partisanship, religion, or social class [@Converse1964; @Dalton1993], as well as from self-interest [@Dalton1993; @Krosnick1990]. However, the effect of group identities on political attitudes seems to have generally declined in recent decades, leading to a more egocentric, "individualized" politics. [@Dalton1993]. Still, some group identities might affect attitudes on at least some issues. For example, studies have documented increasing racialization and partisan polarization of health politics in the US in recent years [@Tesler2012; @Henderson2011]. Self-interest also remains a strong predictor of attitudes on health policy [@Henderson2011], though there may be distinctions between peoples' opinions on their own experience with the health care system and their view of the system as a whole [@Soroka2013].

The models of public opinion presented above and findings of generally low information in the mass public imply that public opinion is not especially stable. Stochastic processes play at least some part in the formation of expressed preferences, though the degree of randomness involved is up for debate. It seems that opinion stability varies across contexts and issues. As discussed above, mass opinion is multidimensional, ambivalent, and "morselized." Thus, we might conceive of differences in the relative noisiness of some signals from the public. Just because scholars present evidence of a lack of stable, clear public opinion in certain issue areas does not mean opinion on all issues is equally unclear and unstable. The relative stability across issues requires empirical measurement, and evidence so far suggests significant variance.

In terms of policy representation, stable opinions provide more reliable signals for elected officials to follow. As explained above, stability is affected by  information. It is difficult for policy makers to distinguish informed voters from uninformed, but they can be aware of the aggregate amount of publicly available information surrounding an issue. When elites and the media talk more about an issue publicly, opinions on that issue can become more stable, holding individual-level awareness constant, and this in turn strengthens the public's position relative to elites. We might reasonably wonder, then, why elites would ever talk about policies publicly. Indeed, they often do not, preferring to operate behind closed doors. However, if political adversaries are talking about a policy issue, that might force elites to go on message themselves in order to not lose the public entirely. This zero-sum competition among elites can lead to a more robust information environment on an issue, and in turn to more stable public opinion. The predictions about valence still apply, but holding all else constant, we would expect to see policy makers more responsive to public opinion when there is more public information and reporting on an issue.

Group identities also affect the stability of public opinion, but group identities vary across members of the public, as does the salience of group identities. Thus, the possibility of affecting public opinion as a whole using group identities is limited. The analysis in chapter 2 on issue publics speaks more to this idea of heterogeneous public opinion signals across groups, and will not be tested further in this chapter.

## Salience

A third factor with potential implications for representation is salience, or the level of importance placed on an issue. This concept has factored very prominently into more recent political science theories [@Burstein2003]. The memory-based model [@Zaller1992a], for example, allows for the effects of salience on expressed opinions by positing that salient considerations will have greater weight in the process of forming an opinion. At an aggregate level, the salience of an issue affects how much the public responds to changes in policy or current conditions [@Soroka2010]. This in turn affects how much elected officials will respond to public opinion on the issue.

One way to conceptualize and measure salience is in terms of attention. At a macro level, theories of punctuated equilibrium in public policy are based on the limited attention citizens and institutions can devote to particular issues at a given time [@Jones2005; @True1999]. This is consistent with Downs' issue attention cycle [-@Downs1972]. @Kingdon1995 also sees cycles of attention to issues in his analysis of the policy areas of health and transportation, with instances of high attention leading at least to significant changes in the political agenda, if not public policy itself. Longer-term studies of health politics in general [@Starr1982; @Starr2011] and Medicare politics in particular [@Oberlander2003; @Marmor1970] also reveal shifts in attention and perceptions of crises in the health system over time. Changes in the overall salience of an issue can change the agenda, an important aspect of policy change.

As with valence and stability, the manner in which politicians perceive salience is important in determining representation. To a certain extent, the US Congress seems to be sensitive to shifts in salience in the manner described [@Jones2005]. However, Congress does not focus all of its attention on the issues the public most cares about. Punctuated equilibrium theorists [@Jones2005; @True1999] tend to explain this in terms of the government's higher institutional capacity, but other theories often explain this phenomenon as differences in the attentiveness and resources of different groups [@Lindblom1965; @Sabatier1988]. Institutional capacity is an important necessary condition identified by punctuated equilibrium models, but just because the government can devote attention to multiple issues does not mean it will without other incentives to do so. Given the evidence so far, it seems apparent that the government has the ability and the incentives to focus on issues about which the public feels most strongly, but that they also devote some attention to other, less salient issues. Thus, not all policy is based on what the public feels is most salient.

Despite these caveats, we might still expect more responsiveness to public opinion in response to changes in the salience of an issue. While pollsters may be able to report an opinion on any given issue, those opinions will not be as important to policy makers unless they are salient to many voters. One important nuance to this prediction is that the issues most voters deem important are probably also issues that draw attention from large and resource-rich groups of policy elites. A robust test of this hypothesis will probably require controls for this confounding factor.

## Summary and Implications

To summarize my hypotheses to this point, public opinion is expected to exert more consistent influence on representatives' behavior under the following conditions, considering each factor individually and holding all other factors constant:

* When public opinion clearly favors a change from the status quo
* When public opinion has a low variance
* When there is more publicly available information about an issue
* When an issue is more salient overall

Cases that satisfy these hypotheses to some extent are readily available, indicating that more rigorous tests are warranted. I plan to develop such tests, using available survey data, election returns, and/ or large demographic datasets.

# Conclusion

## Pulling the Factors Together

In a concluding section of the dissertation, I plan to pull together some thoughts and/ or preliminary analyses of how the factors analyzed separately in the three chapters might interact in reality. Parsimonious models are important for isolating specific factors and mechanisms that are important in complex processes, but drawing implications for the real world often requires reintroduction of real-world complexity. I have no thoughts on specific interactions at this point, but perhaps ideas along these lines will materialize in the process of conducting my analyses. These ideas could suggest fruitful avenues for further research, which I would also detail in the concluding section of the dissertation.

## To-dos

For chapter 1, I need to further develop the theoretical framework on which the hypotheses about representation by whole legislatures rest. The issue is that if the hypothesis about individual legislators is correct, then over time, legislatures will become filled with perfectly responsive legislators who always win election by catering to their median constituents. Such hyper-responsiveness at the level of the individual legislator will prevent parties from governing as cohesive units, according to the theory of conditional party government. This would in turn destroy the party's label, effectively removing any meaningful party competition. This would lead to decreases in party competition causing *more* representative actions by whole legislatures, rather than less as hypothesized. I plan to develop the body of theory on parties further by creating a formal model of parties' candidate selection processes. The outcome of the model, as far as I can tell, is parties that compete well in elections across districts with a broad range of median opinions, but not to the extent that party labels become meaningless. This theoretical development will probably take the form of a separate paper, which will be preliminary to the study on party competition in chapter 1.

I also need to refine my measure(s) of party competition. I have a general idea of what to look for, but there are still many specifics to nail down. These include which elections to use in the measures, how many election years (lags, if you will) to use in the measure of party competition at each point in time, and whether alternative measures based on party financial support are feasible. I plan to use multiple measures in the analysis in order to provide more robust conclusions.

The main items left to address in chapters 2 and 3 are also data-related. In order to conduct the proposed analyses, I need to assess exactly what data I have in terms of issue publics, public opinion, and elite preferences. As with my party competition measures for chapter 1, there are many possible ways to form my measures for these two chapters. I plan to use as many as seem appropriate to test the hypotheses as thoroughly as possible.

## Tentative Timeline

The bulk of this project will involve pulling together various data sources and obtaining datasets suitable for the various proposed analyses. I hope to spend the spring and summer of 2016 doing this, as well as developing and writing the theoretical background paper for chapter 1 mentioned above. This will probably spill into Fall semester 2016, but I hope to finish conducting my first analyses by the end of that semester. Spring semester 2017 will then be devoted to writing and to refining the analyses as needed, based on feedback from the committee and others. At this point, I intend to send regular preliminary drafts of chapters to the committee. Ideally, the conceptual frameworks developed in this prospectus (with edits as suggested before and during the Preliminary Exam) can be used in the actual dissertation chapters, meaning only the analyses and conclusions will be "new" to the committee during the write-up phase. This will leave the 2017-2018 academic year, my fifth year in residence, as an "overflow" period in case the project takes longer than expected, as well as for remaining items (editing, formatting, etc) and for job-search related activities.

# Data Appendix

Many of the analyses in the proposed dissertation will require similar data sources. Since the data used will be similar across chapters, I describe all of my proposed data sources here.

## Legislator and Bill Data

Data on bills comprise the main dependent variables for my analyses. As mentioned above, legislator ideologies can be measured using roll call votes or cosponsorship. I will collect data on bills and roll call votes from GovTrack (www.govtrack.us), an organization that compiles and standardizes data from various official records in a format that is easily usable by researchers and private citizens. GovTrack also has legislator-level data on committee membership, leadership positions, and partisanship. Cosponsorship data is available from either GovTrack or from James Fowler's website.[^7] Where it is appropriate to use roll-call based scaled ideology scores, I will use the common space DW-NOMINATE scores available on Keith Poole's website, voteview.com. I plan to conduct at least some analyses using both data on both the House and Senate, with exceptions noted in the chapters as appropriate.

It is also necessary, for some of my analyses, to identify the policy issues/ topics covered by specific bills. For this, I use the Policy Agendas Project data collected by Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones.[^8] This data is available for all bills between the 80th and 113th Congresses.

At some points in the study, it will be useful to have data on state legislators. One readily available data source for state legislator ideology is Boris Shor and Nolan McCarty's American Legislatures Project, which uses roll call voting and a recurring survey of state legislators to obtain scaled ideal point estimates for all state legislators on a single scale. The data are described in more detail in @Shor2010, and are available online from http://americanlegislatures.com/.

*[Other data on state legislators can be described here as necessary.]*

## Public Opinion

Measures of public opinion will also be obtained from a few different sources. Large-scale surveys provide actual public opinion data that is representative of voters at the state level, which is useful for analyses of representation by Senators. I plan to use two such surveys. The Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) is an Internet-based survey that began in 2006 and was conducted annually until 2012. The Annenberg National Election Surveys (NAES) was fielded in 2000, 2004, and 2008. I will be looking through the codebooks for specific items that will be useful in my project. In addition to survey data, I also plan to use the big-data based ideal point estimates from @Xing2014.

## Election Returns

For analyses involving presidential vote share and party competition in a state or district, I will need election returns. For district-level measures, I will need to use either available precinct- or county-level reports aggregated up to congressional districts. To aggregate county-level returns, I will follow the methodology used in @Ansolabehere2001 for combining county election results into districts. My initial source of precinct-level data for most elections over the last fifteen years is the "Precinct-Level Election Data" project of Steven Ansolabehere, Maxwell Palmer, and Amanda Lee, available at http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/21919. State-level returns are easily obtained from the FEC and other official and academic sources. Precinct- and county-level data are both easily aggregated to the state level. In any cases where I need state-level data for which I do not have precinct data, I will pick a source that is most convenient for my purposes.

## Issue Publics

Data on the size of various issue publics will be collected at the state and, where possible, congressional district levels. For doctors, I will use the CMS' Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data for 2012, which contains practice information for all physicians and provider organizations that billed Medicare that year. Since almost all providers in the country bill Medicare at least once per year, this data covers virtually all physicians. I geocode the practice location information to ascertain the congressional district in which the provider practices. This yields a count of providers practicing in each congressional district. I will use similar data on hospitals (still to be obtained, but likely from CMS or another government agency like HHS or CDC).

Data on Medicare and Medicaid enrollees by state might be available from CMS or another agency. If not, I can try to use Census data on age and income to infer enrollment rates in Medicare and Medicaid respectively. Another possibility is the Census Bureau's Small Area Health Insurance Estimates, which give insurance status estimates (based on modeling techniques) in states and counties. The SAHIE data also gives estimates of the uninsured, another issue public I plan to examine. Another option for measuring the number uninsured is model estimates in the Catalist data.

*[If possible, I would also look at patients with chronic diseases, cancer, etc. as issue publics. I will need to explore data options for this; perhaps CDC has something, or maybe the websites of the various organized groups have some estimates.]*
	
## Campaign Finance and Lobbying

Campaign finance and data will be collected from opensecrets.org, the website of the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). CRP takes their data from the FEC and groups it by industry/ advocacy group type and, for campaign contributions, by candidates. Specifically, I will collect campaign contribution data from physician groups (like the AMA); hospital industry groups (like AHA); insurance industry groups (ex, AHIP); advocacy groups that represent particular patient populations such as seniors (AARP), Medicaid enrollees, and perhaps chronic disease patients; other medical industry groups such as PHrMA; and major party committees and leadership PACs. These data will be collected for all candidates in relevant election cycles. I will also collect lobbying expenditures by these groups for relevant congresses.

## Other Data

Legislator partisanship data is available from a number of sources, including the GovTrack bill and roll call data. To collect whatever demographic information is determined to be necessary for analysis, I will look first at Census Bureau offerings. If that fails, I would turn next to the Catalist dataset.
