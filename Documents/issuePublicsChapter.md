# 2. Issue Publics in Health Policy

Reports of skyrocketing prices for the EpiPen, a product manufactured by pharmaceutical company Mylan to quickly treat anaphylactic shock in people with various allergies, had been circulating for some time before July 2016, according to The New York Times (Parker-Pope 2016). Since 2007, the price for a two-pack of EpiPens increased over 500 percent, from $100 to over $600. That month, a few parents and parent activists with large social media followings decided to start a petition against what they called price gouging. The petition was shared widely across social media, along with personal stories and photographs of receipts showing high prices for the product. Congress took notice, partly due to the 80,000-signature petition and the 121,000 letters sent to them over the course of a few weeks. High-profile politicians such as Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton called on Mylan to lower their prices, and the Republican-controlled Congress held high-profile hearings in which committee members from both parties grilled Mylan's top executives about their pricing practices. By the end of August, Mylan expanded its coupon and patient assistance programs and promised to release a cheaper generic version of the EpiPen. Congress has not introduced any legislation directly related to the EpiPen controversy, but its investigation did lead to the discovery of millions of dollars taken by the company due to misclassifying the EpiPen for Medicaid billing. Mylan agreed to settle the case against it for $465 million [@Thomas2016], more than $60 million higher than the company's 2nd quarter 2016 revenues for EpiPen's entire product segment [@Mylan2016]. Lawmakers' swift response to the public outcry, with its costly end for a large player in a powerful industry, is striking.

Another salient feature of this story is that a relatively small number of people were successful in getting Congress to take a strong public position on the issue. The House of Representatives is comprised of 435 voting members, each representing a district of an average of 710,000 voters. The smallest district is Rhode Island's 1st district, with approximately 526,000. Even if we say that the 80,000 signatures and 121,000 letters were sent by different people (not likely to actually be the case), the resulting 201,000 people yield an average of only 462 voters per district. The uniform distribution of these voters across districts is unlikely, but that only makes it more surprising that so many members of Congress responded the way they did. If the 201,000 were all concentrated in RI-1, where they would likely form a majority of the voting-eligible population, then why would the other 434 members of Congress care? At any rate, a relatively small handful of loosely organized voters seem to have gotten the House's attention, spurring them to take a strong position against the interests of a well-connected pharmaceutical company, all without formal organization.

Another story: during the debate over passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), senior citizens came out strongly opposed to the proposal. The ACA was to cut Medicare Advantage funding significantly, and seniors were afraid of anything they perceived as weakening Medicare (see also Kaiser Family Foundation nd; Roy 2012). The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), which purports to represent seniors' interests, remained publicly neutral on the ACA, and even privately supported the Medicare Advantage cuts. A likely reason for this is the royalties the AARP receives from the sale of licensed Medigap plans, which would come into higher demand as people moved out of Medicare Advantage (Roy 2012). On the ACA, seniors were without the representation of a formal, organized interest group.[^1]

These two anecdotes illustrate that unorganized groups of voters can come together to influence public policy, independent of organized interest groups. The study of group influence in politics has traditionally focused on organized, formal groups, such as the AARP, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), and the American Medical Association (AMA) in the case of health care policy. The EpiPen story is an example of unorganized groups of voters persuading their elected officials to take a position directly counter to the interests of PhRMA and the pharmaceutical industry, which is generally very powerful in American politics. The second story shows an example of attempted influence by unorganized voters without the help of their alleged organized representatives (the AARP). For which groups and in what situations can this kind of influence occur? How might it play out in a complex issue such as health policy? This chapter seeks to explore initial answers to these two yet unstudied questions.

Part of the reason these issues have not been fully explored is lack of available data. In the age of big data and increased computing power, these issues are being removed. Government data transparency initiatives are particularly useful. This paper makes use of government data and geocoding techniques to estimate the number of physicians, seniors, and uninsured residents in a congressional district. This innovative use of data can serve as a model for future studies of group influence.

## 2.1 Background

### 2.1.1 Pluralism

The original pluralist view, espoused by Madison in *Federalist 10* and many others since, is essentially that every voter belongs to a group or faction, and that if all factions are brought together for purposes of making policy, their conflicts and compromises will lead to policy that is not dominated by any one faction. The system works when interest groups, which in theory collectively represent virtually all citizens' interests, are encouraged to compete.

The last century has seen many intellectual challenges to that idea, such as Schattschneider's famous quip that "the problem with the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper class accent" [@Schattschneider1960]. The basic critique of the elite pluralists is that some groups inherently have more resources to leverage than others, leading to an asymmetry of group power. Encouraging interest group competition will only amplify these inequalities.

Indeed, ideas such as Mancur Olson's logic of collective action, by which mass-based groups must operate differently than smaller groups in order to overcome collective action problems and have any chance of success, indicate that mass-based groups might fail to adequately represent larger, generally less privileged groups of voters (for example, seniors, represented by the AARP, or parents of allergic children, who may not have any high-profile organized interest groups representing them) than the pluralists would hope. It is therefore theoretically possible that not every citizen is adequately represented by a competitive group.

Despite the cogent critiques of the elite pluralists, the EpiPen story is an example of how unorganized groups might influence policymakers and policy, particularly in the age of free mass communication via social media and other platforms. Can unorganized groups overcome the power asymmetries pointed out by the elite pluralists? Theoretically, parents are a large group with a lot of voting power. If the collective action problem can be overcome and parents coordinate enough to vote based on their interests as parents, election-seeking members of Congress would have to listen in order to obtain/ maintain office. They apparently felt compelled to do something in the face of just a hundred thousand or so parents taking a stand on the EpiPen issue. Can we expect this to happen in other instances, and for other groups?

One way to get at this question is to think about what determines legislative voting and other behaviors. Some ideas that have been studied extensively in the political science literature are parties, the median voter, and organized interest groups. Do these influences leave any room for unorganized groups of voters to make their influence felt?

### 2.1.2 Legislative Behavior

Given prior research on legislator behavior, there is little doubt that party matters. Partisan polarization has been a defining feature of American politics in recent decades. Research shows the two major political parties have come to take predictable and opposing ideological positions on many major issues [@Cox2005; @Roberts2003; @Rohde1991; @Petrocik1987; @Shafer2006; @Adams2008; @Brady2007; @Burden2001; @Burden2004; @Levendusky2009]. Across a range of studies, from those examining roll call-based ideal points [@Poole1997; @Poole2001] to analyses of electoral patterns [@Jacobson2003], it is clear that political elites are polarized (see also @Hetherington2009). One potential implication of this literature is that legislative voting behavior should simply follow party lines, as with some recent prominent legislation such as the Affordable Care Act and numerous attempts to repeal it, or the Paycheck Fairness Act of 2014. Many issues, including major health care reform, are often cast in partisan terms. The ACA is one clear and prominent example of this schism in Congress. The bill was passed without a single Republican vote in favor. Since its passage, House Republicans have tried repeatedly to repeal it, and Republican congressional and presidential candidates have made repealing and replacing the ACA a major message of their campaigns. Democrats still largely favor the reform bill, providing a stark partisan contrast. This polarization certainly provides a clear choice for voters on Election Day, an important feature of party competition that strengthens accountability (see chapter 1).

However, not all votes in Congress are partisan. The ACA is more of an exception than the rule in this regard. This may not always be easy to see, partly because the calling of roll call votes, the most convenient form of data in studying legislative decisions, is endogenous to party politics in the chamber. Still, there are numerous instances of Democrats and Republicans "crossing the aisle" to vote for the other party's bills, and of members of Congress "working across the aisle" on legislation both parties find desirable. Perhaps this bipartisanship has decreased in recent years as polarization has increased, but it has by no means disappeared completely from Congress, especially on less high-profile bills. Partisanship still matters in predicting votes, but it is not the whole story.

Within the congressional literature, the prominent counter to the party power hypothesis is that district preferences, not party control, determines voting behavior [@Krehbiel1993]. The classic median voter theorem predicts that members of Congress will take positions (in this case, vote) according to the preferences of the median voters in their districts [e.g. @Downs1957; @Mayhew1974]. If legislators represent their constituents in this manner, then legislator votes will correspond to their median voter's preferences. Assuming that ideology is unidimensional, the representative simply picks the median voter's position to ensure reelection. This is the classic notion of democratic representation.

However, previous empirical studies do not always fit well with the assumptions of the median voter model [@Bafumi2010; @Erikson1978; @Kingdon1995]. One potential explanation for this is group dynamics. Rather than viewing constituents as a spectrum, members of Congress might see groups of voters, each with different but not necessarily contradictory demands of their elected officials [@Kingdon1995]. Fenno's [-@Fenno1978] classic study of House members in their constituencies uncovered a great deal of heterogeneity in representatives' perceptions of their constituents. There is also evidence that members of Congress perceive and respond to the interests of different groups on specific issues important to those groups [@Bishin2009; @Hansen2015]. Constituents matter, but not always in the manner the median voter theorem predicts, and there are few explanations for these nuances offered in the congressional literature [@Theriault2011].

The observed deviations from the median voter theorem seem to suggest that groups matter. Often, this is modeled as organized interest groups affecting congressional behavior. It is straightforward to come up with a theoretical mechanism for such influence. Research shows that members of congress are held accountable for their votes on particular issues, such as crime policy [@Bonney2007; @CanesWrone2011], depending on their level of salience at the time of the roll call and regardless of the legislator's voting record overall. Interest groups may play a key role in this dynamic, through their lobbying and campaign finance activities. As interest groups monitor elected officials, they may then try to use their influence to reward (punish) members of Congress who support (oppose) the group's position. Regarding gun policy, @Shaiko1998 document the ability of the National Rifle Association (NRA) to mobilize both its official membership and the larger gun rights community and cite that grassroots mobilization as the reason for the NRA's success in influencing elections and policy. On the other side of the issue, gun control groups have made some strides in organizing themselves effectively, though that process has been a long one @Lambert1998. Theoretically, interest groups may therefore affect roll call votes in Congress.

Whether interest group influence is always manifested is harder to discern from the literature, which contains mixed results on the effects of interest group contributions and lobbying efforts [@Smith1995; @Theriault2011]. Still, there is some evidence that interest groups affect roll call voting at least sometimes on some issues. In an analysis of roll call voting and dairy industry contributions in the mid-1970's, @Welch1982 finds that interest group contributions affected legislator voting behavior, though not as much as other factors like partisanship or the size of the dairy industry in the legislator's district. On gun bills specifically, @Langbein1993 report that NRA contributions are more effective at intensifying support from legislators already committed to pro-gun policies, rather than convincing legislators to change their minds. However, the same study finds that gun control groups were not as successful in any regard in their use of campaign contributions. In a forthcoming paper [@RichardsForth], I find similar results when analyzing the effects of gun-related interest group contributions on roll call votes and cosponsorships.

### 2.1.3 Unorganized Groups

Group influence on members of Congress may not occur solely through parties, voters as a whole, or organized interests. Identifiable but unorganized groups of voters that tend to vote a certain way based on certain issues may also have an effect, independent of any financial or other organized activity, and not in quite the same way as the median voter theorem predicts. Within the public opinion literature, there is recognition that not all individuals care equally about all issues. According to the issue public perspective, voters might not have a coherent set of ideologies on which they base their vote preferences, but they are often knowledgeable or engaged on an issue or two based on self-interest, group identification, and/ or strong personal values [@Krosnick1990].

The notion of issue publics has long played an important role in explaining public opinion and political behavior, but has largely been ignored in the Congressional voting literature. Instead, that literature has largely equated passion surrounding an issue with interest groups, with campaign contributions from these groups as the measurable manifestation of a group's attempts to influence legislative behavior. However, organized groups may be elite-driven, only nominally representing the views of those they claim to represent [@Skocpol2001; @Skocpol2003]. They may also fail to include significant portions of the relevant population. For example, in 2012 only 24 percent of gun owners are members of the NRA, and support for gun control proposals is higher among gun owners who did not belong to the NRA [@Sides2012]. Throughout its history, the American Medical Association has at times been reined in by constituent doctors for being unrepresentative of their opinions [@Starr1982]. This incongruence between interest groups and issue publics suggests that whether or not interest groups have any effect on roll call voting, the issue publics may have distinct effects of their own. Most importantly, issue publics might not be organized at all – the assumption is simply that they are individuals who are more likely to vote on the basis of this policy area, given a collective shared interest in the issue.

Subconstituency theory suggests that groups matter. As @Bishin2009 articulates, group organization is not a necessary condition for group influence—elected officials are better able to achieve their electoral goals by responding to subconstituencies with intensely held views. If these subconstituencies are perceived important to the member’s electoral prospects, they have influence whether those groups are organized or not, and donating campaign contributions or not [@Bishin2009; @Hayes2012; @Bishin2013].

While subconstituency studies show that groups do not need to be organized to effectively gain substantive representation, the literature does not explicitly distinguish between organized interest groups and latent group interests. In the most thorough work on subconstituency theory, Bishin uses a general definition of subconstituencies which, although often operationalized using latent group sizes or opinions, includes members of organized groups as well, with no analytical distinction between the two [see @Bishin2009, 20-21].  Although he recognizes the potential for these interests to be in conflict, Bishin does not explicitly control for campaign contributions in his empirical models. Few analyses have recognized this distinction.

Two recent exceptions provide initial support for the hypothesis that the perceived interests of unorganized groups affect legislator voting behavior independent of the actions of relevant organized groups. In my forthcoming paper on gun politics [@RichardsForth], I find that the number of hunters in a district was correlated with greater support for pro-gun bills and less support for gun control bills in the House. @Hansen2015 make similar conclusions regarding the number of lesbian/ gay/ bisexual (LGB) constituents in a congressional district and House-members' votes on LGB issues.

While these two studies are consistent with the proposed perspective, they both examine issue areas with very simple unidimensional group structures. In this chapter, I explore whether the group interest hypothesis holds for another issue area with more complex group dynamics: health policy. I also begin to make some qualitative suggestions, based on my analysis, of what kinds of groups are influential under what conditions. Specifically, I compare the relationship of unorganized groups of doctors, uninsured adults, and Medicare with legislator support for health-related bills.

In my analysis, I expect to find that unorganized groups have independent correlations with legislator voting behavior in at least some cases, and that different groups have different levels of influence under different circumstances. The latter prediction is vague at this point because these dynamics have not been tested in the literature yet. Therefore, a significant portion of my analysis will be exploratory in this regard. However, I do have some tentative hypotheses about how exactly groups will differ in influence. I expect that groups with more resources (doctors and Medicare beneficiaries) will have more influence than less advantaged groups (the uninsured).

## 2.2 Methods

I will test the hypotheses above using logit models of legislator behavior, with the dependent variable operationalized as agreeing with the Democrats' position on a bill. The Democrats' position is inferred to be the side of the vote that got a majority of Democratic votes. For example, the Democratic position on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is "yes," and anyone voting "no" is counted as voting against the Democratic position in the model.

I present models using three levels of aggregation. An overall model will include all health bill roll call votes, as identified by Policy Agendas Project topic code 3 [@PAP], from the 108th to the 112th Congress (2003-2012). A second set of subtopic models will model voting on bills grouped by Policy Agendas Project minor topic codes. These codes identify, within health policy bills, those that deal with such topics as insurance reform, pharmaceutical and device regulations, provider payment, and legal liability. Finally, I will present separate models limited to the following sets of bills (specific bill and roll call numbers are listed in the appendix):

- The Affordable Care Act, including both bills comprising the ACA, as well as the numerous repeal attempts in the 112th Congress.
- The Help Efficient, Accessible, Low-cost, Timely Healthcare (HEALTH) Act, a medical malpractice liability reform bill that has been introduced numerous times in various forms in the last fifteen years.
- The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (CHIPRA).
- The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), which established the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit and made numerous important changes to Medicare.
- Bills dealing with the Sustainable Growth Rate formula (SGR), a controversial Medicare provider reimbursement model.
- The Contact Lens Consumer Fairness Act of 2003, which requires licensed providers of eye examinations to furnish the patient with a copy of their contact lens prescription.

The following controls will be included in each model, as appropriate:

- Organized groups, operationalized as contributions from four related industry categories
- Unorganized groups, operationalized as the percentage of the district population that belongs to the group
- District characteristics: voter ideology overall, voter ideology on health policy, percent of the district that is white, and percent of adults in the district with only a high school diploma
- Legislator characteristics: age and partisanship
- Bill/ roll fixed effects (when more than one bill/ roll call vote is included) and whether the vote was a party-line vote

Each of these measures will be discussed below in more detail, including data sources and specifications. Because of the fairly large number of bill groups to be examined, I keep the model specification constant across these bill groups.

## 2.3 Data

### 2.3.1 Campaign Finance

To account for the activities of organized interest groups, which I hypothesize to be distinct from unorganized issue publics, I obtained campaign finance data on interest groups that might be thought to represent the issue publics mentioned, as well as those who might have a vested interest in the policy. For example, the American Medical Association and other provider groups contribute heavily to political campaigns, and may be thought of as an organized analog to doctors in general. Campaign finance data by industry/ issue is available from the Center for Responsive Politics' website, opensecrets.org. Specifically, I collected data on donations from healthcare provider groups such as the AMA, hospital groups like the American Hospital Association, other health industry groups such as those that represent insurance and pharmaceutical companies, and the AARP.

In factor analyzing the contribution data, it was apparent that contributions from three distinct industry categories were moving together: HMOs, hospitals, and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers (Opensecrets industry codes Q02, Q03, and Q04). If variables for these three categories were included simultaneously in the logit models, there would be high collinearity. To prevent this, I use the total dollar amount of contributions received from all three of these industry categories.

The other campaign finance measures included in my final models are provider group contributions (Opensecrets industry code Q01), contributions from any Blue Cross/ Blue Shield company, and contributions from the AARP. For ease of interpretation, all four campaign finance measures are scaled to represent thousands of dollars.

### 2.3.2 Issue Publics

As mentioned previously, I will analyze the effectiveness of three potential health-related issue publics: doctors, the uninsured, and the elderly. These represent a wide array of groups, and will allow for some comparison of the responsiveness of members of Congress to each of these groups. Some may be more effective at getting their way than others, and although the tests I will present in this paper will not be able to directly explore these differences in effectiveness, prior research on these groups can be brought to bear in explaining the results. I also expect certain groups to be more represented on specific subtopics. For example, doctors will probably illicit more responsiveness on provider-specific bills. At any rate, having data on multiple potential issue publics will be advantageous in testing the issue public representation hypothesis.

The general strategy for measuring issue public strength is to obtain some estimate of the number of people belonging to a specific group (i.e. Medicaid recipients) in a member of Congress' constituency (states for Senators, districts for House members). Data on the uninsured and Medicare beneficiaries was collected from the Census Bureau's Small Area Health Insurance Estimates data [@SAHIE].

For doctors, I obtained practice data on all providers who billed Medicare in 2012. Using practice address, I geocoded this data and merged it with a congressional district map, thus linking all matched providers to a state and a congressional district.[^2] The assumption that providers affect the votes of the member of Congress in whose district they *practice* (as opposed to district of residence), in addition to being the best the data will allow, is defensible for two reasons. First, it is plausible to assume that doctors live close to their practices. In some urban/ geographically small districts, this may be somewhat more problematic, but controlling for population density should help with this unfortunate measurement error. Second, even if a doctor does not live in a congressional district, it is likely that both members of Congress and their actual constituents will be somewhat familiar with businesses in their districts, including doctors offices. Members of Congress may want to keep economic actors in their districts happy, and doctors have at times been know to transmit messages on policy to their patients/ customers [@Starr1982]. Thus, although the use of practice address is imprecise, it is likely to still provide a good measure of issue public strength, one that will do well at representing the signals actually received by members of Congress.

### 2.3.3 Constituent Ideology

Using data from two publicly available large-N surveys, the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) and the National Annenberg Election Study (NAES), I create an index of district opinion on health policy. The scale is generated using predicted factor scores (regression method based on orthogonal varimax rotation) following factor analysis of the survey response variables. This method allows for the survey questions to have both different scales (3-point, 5-point, etc.) and to have more or less correlation with the underlying construct I am trying to capture (attitudes on health policy). I also control for general constituent ideology estimates using the multilevel regression/ post-stratification estimates the Catalist-based ideal points calculated by @Xing2014. Both variables are coded so that higher values indicate relatively more conservative positions. Similar to DW-NOMINATE scores for legislator votes, these scores of constituent opinion must be interpreted relative to one another.

### 2.3.4 Other Data

Information on the partisan affiliations of members of Congress is obviously necessary, and will be used in this analysis. I also control for the legislator's age, obtained from the govtrack.us website (other personal characteristics, like gender and religion, were not useful in preliminary model specification checks).

I control for the percentage of the district identified in the American Community Survey as white and the percent of adults over 25 in the district the ACS identifies as having only a high school diploma. In preliminary model checks, these turned out to be the most effective, parsimonious way to control for education and race. I also control for district median income, again taken from ACS. Other ACS measures were also examined in the preliminary checks, but were not helpful.

To control for bill and roll call characteristics, I include fixed effects for the bill/ roll call in each model that analyzes more than one vote. I also include an indicator for whether the vote was a party-line vote, which is defined as majorities of the two parties voting opposite ways on the bill in question.

## 2.4 Analysis

### 2.4.1 Overall Model

The overall model gives the effects of the various groups and other controls on all health bills identified by the Policy Agendas Project for the 108th- 112th congresses. Table 2-1 shows the results of this model. The only organized group contributions that are significantly correlated with voting on health bills are those given by the hospital, HMO, and pharmaceutical industries. The coefficient for this effect is fairly small, indicating that a very large amount of money must be contributed to effect much change in voting. The range on this variable is quite large, ranging from essentially 0 up to $531,650. Results do not change substantially when outliers above $200,000 are omitted. Other than contributions from Blue Cross Blue Shield affiliates reaching p = 0.096, no other organized group contributions come close to having a significant correlation with health bill votes.

**Table 2-1: Overall Models of Voting with Democrats on Health Bills, 2003-2012**

**[Table 2-1 here]**

Unorganized groups, on the other hand, are quite significantly correlated with health policy votes in Congress. The percentage of the district that can be classified as physicians is quite highly correlated with voting (p < 0.001). The range on this variable is small (from 0.05% to 1.2%), but it is clear from the model that as this measure increases, MCs are more likely to vote with Democrats. Having more seniors in the district is also associated with voting more heavily Democratic, though this effect is not quite significant at conventional levels (p = 0.054).

The uninsured rate in the district, on the other hand, has the opposite relationship. The more uninsured reside in a district, the more likely the representative is to vote with Republicans (p < 0.001 for the uninsured coefficient). This finding is somewhat surprising, given the general perception that Democrats tend to (at least purportedly) champion the rights of disadvantaged groups like the uninsured. This counterintuitive finding comes up in most of the other models run for this chapter, and is robust to various alternative specifications. Including party, percent Hispanic, education, median income do not affect the negative observed relationship. A naive model in which only percent uninsured is used to predict agreement with the Democrats yields a similar negative finding (b = -0.028, p < 0.001), as do limited versions (not shown) of the model in Table 2-1. Perhaps the best way to explain this finding is that members of Congress are perceiving uninsured interests differently than we expect. It is also possible that members of Congress are responding to some group of voters whose interests are opposite those of the uninsured but whose presence is positively correlated with uninsured rates, but it is not obvious what measures could be included in the model to correct this omitted variable bias that are not already included.

One other finding that stands out is that both overall ideology and opinions on health policy among voters overall matter very strongly for votes on health bills (for both, p < 0.01). The directions of these effects are predictable: more conservative average opinions among voters are correlated with voting for the Republicans on a bill. Regarding district demographics, median income and percent Hispanic are both positively correlated with voting with the Democrats. It is worth noting the presence of these controls given the odd finding for uninsured individuals mentioned above. Both median income and percent Hispanic are highly correlated with the uninsured rate, and yet the coefficient on uninsured is robust to the inclusion of these two variables.

The overall model, despite controlling for roll call fixed effects and Policy Agendas Project minor topic code, probably masks a lot of heterogeneity. The context of debate and passage of any particular bill or topic is probably very different, in ways the overall model may not capture. It is also possible that different groups (both organized and unorganized) will have different associations with voting behavior on different bills. If we think that organized groups will care more about specific bills relevant to them, whereas unorganized groups of voters will care more about general principles, then it makes sense that unorganized groups will be more important in predicting MC voting trends overall. Next, I turn to models of voting on bills within the PAP minor topic codes.

### 2.4.2 Minor Topic Code

Analysis of voting patterns by minor topic code reveal interesting patterns. Table 2-2 gives the group coefficients for each model. Other controls are included as described in the methods section, and are shown in appendix Table A2-1.

**Table 2-2: Models of Voting with Democrats on Health Bills by Subtopic**

**[Table 2-2 here]**

Contrary to the finding in the overall model, hospital/ HMO/ pharma contributions show a significant correlation on only one topic (insurance reform), and in that case the correlation with voting for the Democratic position is negative. Again, the coefficient is small in magnitude. Blue Cross Blue Shield contributions rise significantly with votes for the Republican position on comprehensive reform, facilities, and prevention, but moves toward the Democratic position on health research. AARP contributions are negatively correlated with the Democrats' position on mental illness bills. Some of these individual findings are counterintuitive. For example, the AARP, given seniors' probable interest in mental health services, does not seem like it would be going against the Democrats on that issue.

Unorganized groups seem to matter somewhat more frequently. When the coefficients are significant, their signs are the same as those given in the overall model (seniors and physicians toward the Democrats, uninsured toward the GOP). In fact, the signs on most of the unorganized group coefficients in Table 2-2 (significant or not) are very consistent. The signs for the organized groups, by contrast, change much more frequently. This could indicate that the unorganized groups are more predictable in their positions, at least from a statistical point of view, while organized groups take more nuanced positions that are seemingly independent of their positions on other topics.

Average voter opinions on health policy and average voter ideology (not shown in Table 2-2) are often significant, though not always. Again, the coefficients take the predictable negative direction indicating conservative voters are associated with more MC agreement with Republican positions.

Even these subtopic models mask a lot of underlying heterogeneity, so I drill down even further in the next section by discussing models of specific bills and bill groups.

### 2.4.3 Specific Bill Groups

The models for each of the six bill groups I analyze are given in appendix Table A2-2. To help illustrate the discussion below, I will show graphs of predicted probabilities of voting with Democrats on the bill group. The figure notes give details on how to interpret the graphs.

On the Affordable Care Act and the various repeal efforts in the 112th Congress, two group variables were significantly correlated with votes: percent physicians, which tended to be higher for those voting in favor of the ACA, and the uninsured rate, which runs the opposite direction. Figure 2-1 below shows these two relationships. No organized group contributions were significant, and average voter opinion on health policy was significant. On this complex bill, it seems voters, both as a whole and certain groups in particular, mattered more than contributions from organized interest groups.

![Figure 2-1: Voting with Democrats on ACA Bills by Percent Physicians and Percent Uninsured](C:\Users\Robbie\Documents\dissertation\Analysis\Figs\fig2-1.png)

Note: The figure shows predicted probabilities of voting with the Democrats on ACA-related bills across the ranges of the specified independent variables. The predictions are derived from the ACA model shown in the Appendix, with other variables held constant at their means. The blue horizontal lines indicate the percentage of votes going to the Democratic position, essentially the mean of the dependent variable. The gray dashed lines are confidence intervals on the predictions, trimmed at 0 and 1. These confidence intervals do not indicate significance of the slope coefficients. In this figure, both coefficients are statistically significant (p < 0.05).

One issue on which voters and voter groups do not seem to matter is the HEALTH Act, a medical malpractice/ tort reform bill that has been introduced in various forms by Republicans many times throughout the decade being examined. This bill is strongly supported by organized provider groups like the American Medical Association. The model shows that contributions from the AMA do indeed seem to be correlated with voting for the HEALTH Act (the Republican position). Contributions from Blue Cross Blue Shield have a similar relationship with voting. None of the unorganized group variables are significant for this bill group, and neither are the voter opinion measures.

Another interesting thing to note about the HEALTH Act is that although organized medicine is in favor of the bill and their coefficient is negative in the model, the coefficient for percent physicians is positive, indicating a countervailing trend. Figure 2-2 shows these trends, and also indicates that even though the slope coefficient on percent physicians is not quite significant, there is enough confidence in the predicted probabilities at the low end of the range to indicate a departure from the mean probability. Organized medicine wants the HEALTH Act, but it would seem MCs are perceiving more opposition to the proposal from physician voters in their districts.

Note: The figure shows predicted probabilities of voting with the Democrats on HEALTH Act bills across the ranges of the specified independent variables. The predictions are derived from the HEALTH Act models\ shown in the Appendix, with other variables held constant at their means. The blue horizontal lines indicate the percentage of votes going to the Democratic position, essentially the mean of the dependent variable. The gray dashed lines are confidence intervals on the predictions, trimmed at 0 and 1. These confidence intervals do not indicate significance of the slope coefficients. In this figure, only the provider contribution coefficient is statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Industry experts often cite a fundamental tension between providers and payers in health care, due to the frequently competing interests of the two groups. While this division is not always manifest, as my models on the HEALTH Act show, it does show up in other contexts, such as the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). Blue Cross Blue Shield, my proxy for the private payer industry, tended to contribute higher amounts to those who favored MMA (the Republican position), while those who opposed the bill tended to have more physicians in their district. Figure 2-3 shows this finding. It is interesting to note that it is not organized medicine that is the most significant coefficient opposing BCBS, but rather the measure of unorganized physicians. The provider contribution coefficient is neither large nor significant.

Note: The figure shows predicted probabilities of voting with the Democrats on the MMA across the ranges of the specified independent variables. The predictions are derived from the MMA model shown in the Appendix, with other variables held constant at their means. The blue horizontal lines indicate the percentage of votes going to the Democratic position, essentially the mean of the dependent variable. The gray dashed lines are confidence intervals on the predictions, trimmed at 0 and 1. These confidence intervals do not indicate significance of the slope coefficients. In this figure, both coefficients are statistically significant (p < 0.01).

Most of the bill groups I have chosen involve somewhat controversial issues. Almost all votes on these bills fell along party lines. What if the issue is not one characterized by partisan conflict? A group of insurance reform bills in the 108th Congress presents the most cohesive group of bills I could find on which there was little partisan conflict, judging by voting record. On these bills, the uninsured tend to be more prevalent in districts whose representatives voted with the Republicans. Average health opinions are also significant. No other group variables were significantly related to voting, but there are no real surprises in the model, compared to the overall models and the subtopic models.

## 2.5 Discussion

The analysis presented in this chapter shows that although the content and/ or context of a particular bill might change the relationship, there is often an independent link between the size of a group of voters in a legislative district and the voting behavior of the district's representative on health policy. This is the case even controlling for average opinions of all voters in the district and campaign contributions of organized groups. In some cases, such as that of physicians and the Medicare Modernization Act, organized group correlations are actually opposite those of their unorganized group counterparts. These findings fit with the initial hypothesis.

There are a couple of important limitations to the analysis which bound the implications that can be drawn. First, there is no indication from this analysis whether the perceptions of unorganized groups' interests are being driven by organized groups. This could happen, for example, through the efforts of the AARP to have their members (at least those in favor of the AARP's position) call or write to their elected officials. This would have the effect of making it look like seniors think a certain way about an issue when in fact the sample on which that perception is based is not representative. The cases in which contributions and group sizes have opposite effects are unlikely to suffer from this limitation, but this situation is not universal.

A second limitation is that campaign contributions may not be the best proxy for organized group activities aimed at influencing policy. My research design requires data tied to specific members of Congress, but such data does not exist for activities like lobbying or grassroots mobilization efforts. Campaign contributions are linked explicitly to a single representative, but may not be a group's favored or most effective method of persuasion. Furthermore, different groups may have different strategies. Some may rely quite heavily on campaign contributions, while others might make only a few token contributions while relying more on other strategies.

With those limitations in mind, it is still reasonable to conclude from this analysis that unorganized voters might matter in some cases, independent of the other activities of organized groups. One key implication of this is that efforts to affect the perceptions members of Congress have about certain key groups might in turn influence their votes on related bills. Sometimes, the perceptions could be hard to change. For example, it would be difficult to tell convince members of Congress that physicians want lower Medicare reimbursement rates. However, it might be possible to make the case that doctors want more or less spending on cancer research, more or less restrictions on pharmaceuticals, etc.

Subconstituency theory suggests that the groups must also be perceived to vote based on the issue at hand. It could be the case that the uninsured, for example, are not often viewed as a politically cohesive group of voters. Cross-cutting identities may obscure the interests of the uninsured in terms of voting power. Campaigns to make certain identities more salient for voters and their elected officials may be effective at getting certain policies passed. However, such actions probably require coordination and resources, and will therefore not usually arise organically from within large groups of voters.

Future studies on the influence of unorganized groups should use different levels of analysis to further establish the validity of these findings. For example, it would be helpful to find some way to look at legislators themselves (not just their votes, as I do in this chapter) and how they view various groups of constituents.

## Bills

- HEALTH Act (Medical malpractice tort reform)
	- Bills:
		- 108-HR-5
		- 108-HR-4280
		- 109-HR-5
		- 112-HR-5
	- As shown by the long time span of bills on this issue, it is a long-standing issue. No real "flash point" in the past 20 years, at least.
	- Good summary of tort reform principles and the state level reforms: http://www.thehealthlawpartners.com/files/rm332_p30-36_features.pdf
	- Law firm summary of the 112th Congress version, says AMA supports it, and that most Dems and some Republicans oppose: http://www.mahoneylaw.com/Articles/Federal-Tort-Reform-Bill-Would-Cap-Medical-Malpractice-Awards.shtml
		- Dem opponents: arbitrary caps, not good enough for particularly bad cases
		- GOP opponents: government intrusion into state and private matters, but most Republicans support it.
	- Models say only organized group influence is present. Unorganized groups, including doctors, not important.
- Affordable Care Act and related bills
	- Bills:
		- 111-HR-3590
		- 111-HR-3962 (vote 887)
		- 112-HR-2 (repeal)
		- 112-HR-1213 (repeal)
		- 112-HR-2576 (GOP unfriendly modification)
		- 112-HR-6079 (repeal)
	- Obviously, Dems almost all in favor, GOP all opposed. More variation on the repeal bills, but not much.
	- Big deal in public discourse overall, might be hard to tease out specific group influence, but that doesn't mean it's not there...
	- AMA supports the ACA (get source)
	- AARP supported the bill privately and remained neutral in public, even about the Medicare cuts (see this Forbes article; get other sources along these lines: http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2012/09/22/the-aarps-2-8-billion-reasons-for-supporting-obamacares-cuts-to-medicare/#172a87f07006)
		- This is in spite of Seniors' opposition to the ACA (more than any other age group: http://www.weeklystandard.com/seniors-oppose-obamacare-27-points/article/552458)
		- Interesting highlight of a conflict of interest here: AARP is not just an advocacy group; they are also in the business of selling Medigap plans. The profits from the bill and the many carve-outs Forbes article mentions must have made the AARP less responsive to seniors than to their other business line.
	- *Anything else to say about this one?*
	- Model results:
		- Interesting that the organized groups are not effective, but the latent doctor groups move members in the direction of the AMA.
		- Also, seniors make MCs less likely to approve of ACA; could be a "hands off my Medicare" thing. *What does AARP say about ACA?*
- CHIP Reauthorization 2007
	- Bills:
		- 110-HR-3963 (3 votes)
		- 110-HR-976 (3 votes)
	- Model: Hard to say why increased uninsured rate makes MCs *less* likely to vote with Dems; look into the bills more closely...
- Others Bills:
	- MMA 2003: 108-HR-1 (2 votes)
		- Physicians in favor of DEM position (no), organized groups favor GOP
	- SGR/ Doc fix bills (111-HR-3961 (vote 909), 110-HR-6331 (votes 443 and 491; last is veto override))
		- on MIPPA (6331): http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/16/nation/na-medicare16
		- Models say that seniors and organized groups mattered, in opposite directions.
	- Contact Lens Consumer Fairness Act (108-HR-3140)
		- physicians and organized groups have opposite effects; interesting... (hard to get effects when there are so few nay votes)
	- Other 108th congress insurance reform bills (minor == 302; lots of party disagreement)
		- seniors and uninsured rate move in opposite directions

I geocoded the practice address and mapped that onto the district boundaries for each of the five congresses used in my analysis. This of course makes the assumption that there were no significant changes in the relative numbers of providers across districts over time. Geocoding was performed in ESRI's ArcMap using Duke University's US address locater. A confidence threshold of 72 out of 100 yielded a unique location match rate of approximately 86 percent of records in the CMS file. Another pass of the geocoding algorithm using a threshold of 45 provided matches for an additional three percent of records. About three percent of records had multiple matches, and the remaining nine percent could not be matched (usually because of poorly formatted addresses). I exclude the twelve percent of records which were not matched successfully to a single location.
