  Abstract                 = {We examine the proposition that incentives for legislative organization can be explained by the nature of electoral competition. We argue that legislators in environments where parties are competitive for majority status are most likely to have delegated power to their leadership to constrain individualistic behavior within their party, which will in turn increase the spatial predictability of individual voting patterns. Using roll-call votes and district-level electoral data from the U.S. state legislatures, we show empirically that increased statewide interparty competition corresponds to more predictable voting behavior overall, while legislators from competitive districts and those in the minority party have less predictable behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to measure the strength of the parties in each state, the Major Party Index (MPI) was built by averaging the results of the six major elections that take place in the fifty states. This index allows us to describe the absolute and comparative partisan leaning of each state in each election and identify trends of party strength over time within individual states, among regions, and within the nation as a whole. The MPI sheds considerable light on three general developments: (1) a national change from Democratic dominance in the 1980s to a Republican edge by 2002, (2) significant regional realignments in the South and New England, and (3) a strong trend toward greater consistency between partisan voting at the federal and state levels.},

This article argues that legislative parties’ strategic incentives and capabilities are a function of their size, their ideological homogeneity, and the governor’s party. It shows that the distribution of legislative seats between the parties influences legislative efficiency, depending on the level of polarization between the parties and the party of the governor. A small partisan seat margin reduces legislative efficiency when the parties are polarized and when the government is divided. It provides further evidence that polarization and divided government can either positively or negatively affect legislative efficiency, depending on the distribution of seats held between the two parties. This research contributes to the literature by demonstrating the conditional influence of political parties. Based in multilevel modeling techniques, this research also contributes to the literature with robust evidence including 48 state legislatures, through 19 years.},

Although the competition/cohesion thesis dates to the 1940s, it has never before been subject to a test with data from the 50 states. Drawing upon newly available data, we take stock of the evidence. Five measures of party competition are used: (1) the number of recent shifts of party control, (2) an index of party competition for state offices, (3) the closeness of presidential elections in the state, (4) the effective number of political parties in the state, and (5) the ratio of Republicans to Democrats in the electorate. Nearly all of these measures correlate with higher levels of party polarization in both the lower and upper chambers, and none are associated with a lower level of polarization.},

  Abstract                 = {Objectives. What are the sources of partisan competition in state legislative elections? Specifically, what impact do institutional features have relative to district-level conditions on competition between party nominees?Methods. Using data from 30 states in 1994 and 1996, a range of factors are examined to determine their influence on both the likelihood that a race is contested and the degree of competition that results.Results. Multiple regression analyses indicate that a district's characteristics, measured as social and partisan diversity, have a strong and durable influence on elections. Contested elections are more likely and competition levels are higher in districts with heterogeneous populations. Institutional characteristics such as legislative professionalism also have a large influence, although the direction of their impact varies by stage of the electoral process examined. For example, professionalism increases the likelihood that an election is contested, but leads to a lower level of competition between opposing candidates.Conclusions. District-level conditions have a large influence on competition; however, incentives created by institutional features are also critical for understanding the competitiveness of state legislative elections.},

One commonly used indicator of competition in the states is the Ranney index. We offer an alternative indicator of competition, one based on district-level outcomes of state legislative elections. After evaluating both indicators in terms of validity and reliability, the analysis suggests that the district-level indicator is both empirically and intuitively superior as a measure of electoral competition. The implications of this finding are discussed. },

Using a large dataset, I estimate the determinants of state tax effort and compare across jurisdictions the effects of variables that measure the partisan control of government. The results demonstrate that while the partisanship of elected officials is an important predictor of tax effort in pure representative jurisdictions, the relationship between party and policy disappears among initiative states. This analysis not only adds to our understanding of U.S. state budgeting, but also suggests the widespread adoption of direct democracy as a possible explanation for the weak party effects observed in studies of state fiscal policy.},

However, using a statewide measure masks important variations in party competition, especially when considering the behavior of individual state legislators. This is so because the statewide measure may bear no similarity to party competition in an individual legislator's district. We investigated party competition for state legislative seats in eight states during 1892-1972. Our analysis reveals that state legislative party competition is on the decline in this century, with some exceptions. Our data support Burnham's work on electoral disaggregation and the atrophy of the party system, and show substantial differences between the classification of states according to statewide electoral competition and classification according to state legislative competition.},

Both measure “competition” and were previously correlated with one another, so researchers might be tempted to consider them two measures of the same concept. This would be mistaken, however, because they are measuring two distinct concepts. We use new data on state legislative partisan balance and election returns to compute (and make publicly available) the two measures of competition from 1970 to 2003, a time span that is significantly longer than any previous study. We show that the relationship between the two measures has drastically changed over the last 30 years. Although the two measures were positively correlated in the 1970s and 1980s, they are now (as we might expect, given they are different concepts) negatively correlated. We investigate one possible explanation for this change and conclude by discussing a set of practical recommendations for scholars who plan to incorporate a measure of competition in future studies.},

  Abstract                 = {The article examines patterns of interparty competition at the district level in legislative elections occurring in the American states during the 1970s. Data were collected for more than 90% of the district contests during the period. Results are reported by year, state, and chamber. Included are data on mean Democratic vote percentages, proportions of marginal districts, and proportions of uncontested districts. Democratic means were found to have varied considerably in many states during the decade, rising most sharply in 1974 and declining in later elections. Marginality decreased in a majority of states during the period, while uncontested districts (including Republican-held ones) increased in number in many states.},

  Abstract                 = {This article seeks to introduce an alternative notion of time into the cross-sectional study of the causes and effects of interparty competition in the American states. Past studies which average interparty competition over long periods ignore important conceptual and methodological issues. As a result, some empirical findings which have acquired the status of conventional wisdom may be subject to question. It is suggested that many problems may be overcome by measuring interparty competition over very short periods of time. Sequential cross-sectional analysis identifies some relationships with interparty competition which are static over time and others which are dynamic over time.},

  Abstract                 = {This work examines constituency-level competition in U.S. state legislative races for the period 1968-88 using two measures of competition—proportion of seats marginal and proportion of seats contested. An incentive model is assessed to determine the impact of four variables—legislative institutionalization, incumbency, the likelihood of the minority party taking control of the chamber, and legislative performance—in a pooled time-series analysis. We find some support for the impact of the explanatory variables, particularly legislative institutionalization and incumbency. Finally, we present both descriptive and statistical evidence that the degree of constituency-level competition is decreasing during the time period under study.},
