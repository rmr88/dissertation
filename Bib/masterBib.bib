  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT This article uses data from the American National Election Studies and national exit polls to test Fiorina's assertion that ideological polarization in the American public is a myth. Fiorina argues that twenty-first-century Americans, like the midtwentieth-century Americans described by Converse, "are not very well-informed about politics, do not hold many of their views very strongly, and are not ideological" (2006, 19). However, our evidence indicates that since the 1970s, ideological polarization has increased dramatically among the mass public in the United States as well as among political elites. There are now large differences in outlook between Democrats and Republicans, between red state voters and blue state voters, and between religious voters and secular voters. These divisions are not confined to a small minority of activists---they involve a large segment of the public and the deepest divisions are found among the most interested, informed, and active citizens. Moreover, contrary to Fiorina's suggestion that polarization turns off voters and depresses turnout, our evidence indicates that polarization energizes the electorate and stimulates political participation.},

These measures are applied to the Miller-Stokes data on American Congressmen. The findings revise Miller and Stokes' conclusions in two respects: (1) winners are less representative than losers on two of the three measures, and (2) all issue dimensions are approximately equally well represented, with civil rights views having no special advantage.},

The authors extend this research by examining whether parties adjust their ideologies in response to two possible influences: shifts in public opinion, and past election results. Their empirical analyses, which are based on the Comparative Manifesto Project&apos;s codings of parties&apos; post-war programmes in eight West European nations, suggest that parties respond to shifts in public opinion, but that these effects are only significant in situations where public opinion is clearly shifting away from the party&apos;s policy positions. By contrast, no evidence is found here that parties adjust their ideologies in response to past election results. These findings have important implications for parties&apos; election strategies and for models of political representation. },

We model policy and valence issues for office-seeking candidates facing such two-stage elections. We determine a Nash equilibrium for the candidates' optimal strategies, and we find that holding a primary is likely to increase a party's chances of winning the general election, particularly in situations where valence issues that involve the candidates' campaigning skills and that are not known prior to the campaign are more salient than policy issues. Furthermore, we find that primary elections are especially likely to benefit parties that expect to be underdogs in the general election. Our conclusions are directly relevant to U.S. politics and by extension to the strategic decisions that many Latin American parties currently confront, about whether it is strategically desirable to hold primaries.},

We estimate ideal points from bill cosponsorship data using principal-component analysis on an agreement matrix that included information on all bills introduced in the U.S. House (1973–2000) and Argentine Chamber (1983–2002). The ideal-point estimates of legislators' revealed preferences based on cosponsorship data strongly correlate with similar estimates derived from roll-call vote data. Also, cosponsorship activity in the U.S. House has lower dimensionality than cosponsorship has in the Argentine Chamber. We explain this lower discrimination as a function of individual- and district-level factors in both countries.},

From the 1940s to 1970s, candidates became much more responsive to district interests, but that degree of responsiveness waned in the 1980s and 1990s.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the relationship between the preferences of American voters and the preferences of
the U.S. legislators who represent them. Using an Internet-based, national opinion survey in
conjunction with legislator voting records from the 109th and 110th Congresses, we show that
members of Congress are more extreme than their constituents, i.e., that there is a lack of congruence
between American voters and members of Congress. We also show that when a congressional legislator
is replaced by a new member of the opposite party, one relative extremist is replaced by an opposing
extremist. We call this leapfrog representation, a form of representation that leaves moderates with a
dearth of representation in Congress. We see evidence of leapfrog representation in states and House
districts and in the aggregate as well: the median member of the 109th House was too conservative
compared to the median American voter, yet the median of the 110th House was too liberal. Thus, the
median American voter was leapfrogged when the 109th House transitioned to the 110th. Although
turnover between the 109th and 110th Senates occurred at approximately the same rate as between the
109th and 110th Houses, the Senate appears to be a more moderate institution whose median member
does not move as abruptly as that of the House.},

  Abstract                 = {The past few years have seen the emergence of claims that the political determinants of health do not get due consideration and a growing demand for better insights into public policy analysis in the health research field. Several public health and health promotion researchers are calling for better training and a stronger research culture in health policy. The development of these studies tends to be more advanced in health promotion than in other areas of public health research, but researchers are still commonly caught in a na\"{i}ve, idealistic and narrow view of public policy. This article argues that the political science discipline has developed a specific approach to public policy analysis that can help to open up unexplored levers of influence for public health research and practice and that can contribute to a better understanding of public policy as a determinant of health. It describes and critiques the public health model of policy analysis, analyzes political science's specific approach to public policy analysis, and discusses how the politics of research provides opportunities and barriers to the integration of political science's distinctive contributions to policy analysis in health promotion.},

The common pool of contributors who give across institutions and levels of politics makes it possible to recover a unified set of ideological measures for members of Congress, the president and executive branch, state legislators, governors, and other state officials, as well as the interest groups and individuals who make political donations. Since candidates fundraise regardless of incumbency status, the method estimates ideal points for both incumbents and nonincumbents. After establishing measure validity and addressing issues concerning strategic behavior, I present results for a variety of political actors and discuss several promising avenues of research made possible by the new measures.},

  Abstract                 = {Why do legislators sometimes engage in behavior that deviates from the expressed policy preferences of constituents who participate in politics at high rates? We examine this puzzle in the context of Democratic legislators' representation of their senior citizen constituents on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). We find that legislators' roll-call votes on the ACA did not reflect the stated preferences of their respective senior constituents; by contrast, these roll-call votes did reflect the preferences of nonsenior adults. We draw upon a theoretical framework developed by Mansbridge to explain this apparent nonresponsiveness to seniors on the ACA. This framework distinguishes between promissory representation, whereby legislators merely respond to constituents' preferences, and anticipatory representation, whereby legislators respond to constituents' underlying policy interests, even when such interests conflict with expressed preferences. By considering the Medicare provisions in the ACA and analyzing Democratic legislators' floor speeches on health reform, we provide preliminary evidence that members of Congress engaged in anticipatory representation of their senior constituents by attempting to educate seniors about how the ACA serves their policy interests.},

Relative to general-election voters, primary voters favor more ideologically extreme candidates. We show that congressional candidates handle the dilemma by positioning themselves closer to the primary electorate. This article thus supports the idea that primaries pull candidates away from median district preferences.},

Critics of reform pointed to poll results as evidence that a majority of Americans opposed sweeping changes. Supporters cited polls showing that people favored many specific aspects of the legislation. A closer examination of past and present polling shows that opinion tracked with historic patterns and was relatively stable, even if the contentious public debate suggested a volatile public mood in 2009 and 2010. Going forward, the public will begin reacting to reform implementation, primarily by judging it in terms of their perceptions of and experiences with what the new law does and does not do for people. These opinions could in turn influence implementation or future legislation.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Theory suggests that three factors â€“ the importance of ideology to primary voters, costly movement due to candidate reputations and lack of competition â€“ all contribute to candidate divergence in US congressional elections. These predictions are analysed with new data from a 2000 mail survey that asked congressional candidates to place themselves on a leftâ€“right ideological scale. The data reveal that candidates often diverge, but that the degree of candidate polarization is variable and may be explained by factors in the theory. Candidates with firm public reputations, those who face weak general election competition, and those who experience stiff primary competition are all more likely to deviate from the median voter&apos;s position. Perhaps more importantly, the locations that candidates adopt have clear effects on their vote shares. },

The source of data is publications published in major journals and included in major literature reviews, systematically coded to record the impact of public opinion on policy. The major findings include: the impact of public opinion is substantial; salience enhances the impact of public opinion; the impact of opinion remains strong even when the activities of political organizations and elites are taken into account; responsiveness appears not to have changed significantly over time; and the extent to which the conclusions can be generalized is limited.

Scholars of electoral turnout have too often restricted themselves to a relatively narrow range of independent variables, and have failed to include important political influences in analyses. In this study, grounded in the data of the 1978 National Election Study and augmented by additional contextual variables, we develop five alternative models of electoral turnout—legal restrictions, socioeconomic characteristics, social-psychological attitudes, economic conditions, and political mobilization. We especially emphasize the mobilization of voters via campaign spending, partisan competition, contestation of elections, and the presence of other, more salient races. Political mobilization survives and thrives even when we take into account the more conventional explanations of turnout at the polls. In conclusion, we suggest that accountings for participation which omit political mobilization are partial and suspect. },

It shows that existing policies feed back into the political system, shaping subsequent policy outcomes. Policies exert this effect by altering not only the capacities, interests, and beliefs of political elites and states but also those of the public. Public policies can shape political participation and attitudes. These effects can be positive or negative, enhancing or undercutting participation and conferring positive or negative messages about individuals' worth as citizens. These effects originate in elements of program design, such as the size, visibility, and traceability of benefits, the proximity of beneficiaries, and modes of program administration. Thus, public policy itself shapes the distance of citizens from government, with profound implications for democratic governance. },

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Does a typical House member need to worry about the electoral ramifications of his roll-call decisions? We investigate the relationship between incumbents' electoral performance and roll-call support for their party—controlling for district ideology, challenger quality, and campaign spending, among other factors—through a series of tests of the 1956–1996 elections. The tests produce three key findings indicating that members are indeed accountable for their legislative voting. First, in each election, an incumbent receives a lower vote share the more he supports his party. Second, this effect is comparable in size to that of other widely recognized electoral determinants. Third, a member's probability of retaining office decreases as he offers increased support for his party, and this relationship holds for not only marginal, but also safe members. },

We examine this question on the issue of crime, for which salience has varied substantially and opinion has favored Republicans, and the environment, for which salience has not varied much and voters have favored Democrats. Because different parametric specifications produce divergent findings, we utilize matching analysis in addition to ordinary least squares. The tests suggest that issue accountability exists even controlling for a member's overall record. However, such accountability depends crucially on issue salience and a member's partisan affiliation.},

The selection of votes for roll call may be endogenous to exactly the characteristics of voting behavior (for instance, party cohesion) that we want to study. We must understand the roll-call vote institution and account for its selection effects before we can draw inferences about legislative behavior from roll-call results. This article develops a game-theoretic model of roll-call vote requests predicated on party leaders requesting votes to enforce party discipline. The model offers general and testable predictions about the selection process and how it affects observed and unobserved legislative voting behavior, particularly party cohesion.},

Thus, if these votes are not a random sample of the universe of votes cast, scholars may be drawing misleading inferences. In fact, theories over why roll-call votes are requested would predict selection bias based on exactly the characteristics of legislative voting that scholars have most heavily studied. This article demonstrates the character and severity of this sampling problem empirically by examining European Parliament vote data for a whole year. Given that many legislatures decided only a fraction of their legislation by roll call, these findings have potentially important implications for the general study of legislative behaviour. },

The MPI sheds considerable light on three general developments: (1) a national change from Democratic dominance in the 1980s to a Republican edge by 2002, (2) significant regional realignments in the South and New England, and (3) a strong trend toward greater consistency between partisan voting at the federal and state levels.},

Reversing Downs (1957), we assume that parties win elections in order to formulate policies, rather than formulate policies in order to win elections. Voters are modeled first as having perfect information about candidate positions, and then under conditions of uncertainty. In simulation experiments we show that policy motivation and voter uncertainty can bring about persistent and predictable party differences in sequential majority rule elections. As the degree of voter certainty decreases, parties diverge towards their optima, whereas increases in voter certainty draw parties towards cycles in which party positions vary, but predictable issue stances are maintained on the average. },

  Abstract                 = {Medicare was bitterly opposed by the medical profession before it became law in 1965. This paper examines how individual physicians reacted, in their behavior and in their thinking, to Medicare after it became law. The more general issue is the role of law as an instrument of social change. Interviews with a sample of New York State physicians before the law was passed and reinterviews at two points in time after the law was passed--once before the program went into effect and again about six months after it had gone into effect--make it possible to separate the direct effects of the law itself on attitudes from the effects of short-term experience with the program. There has been no evidence of a physicians' boycott of Medicare. With respect to their attitudes, the proportion of physicians in favor of the main part of Medicare, the hospitalization program for the elderly (Title 18, Part A), jumped from 38% before the law was passed to 70% ten months after it was passed, even before it was implemented, and again to 81% six months after it was implemented. Some laws, according to these results, may influence attitudes without first changing behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {Nationally representative samples of senior physicians, interns and residents, and medical students were interviewed during the spring of 1973. The main focus of the present analysis is senior physicians' responses to national health insurance issues. The level of support among physicians is underestimated by physicians themselves. Despite the fact that 56 per cent of the doctors were in favor of "some form of national health insurance," almost three-fourths of the respondents believed that most doctors they knew personally were opposed. More than four-fifths of the physicians believed that NHI was inevitable, and those who saw NHI as inevitable were more likely to favor it. Doctors' views about NHI were closely related to their general political views. In general, attitudes of AMA members and grassroots state and local medical society leaders were not greatly divergent. In terms of responses to specific components differentiating NHI alternatives, physicians preferred conservative options on how a program was to be financed and administered as well as whether the development of prepaid groups should be encouraged. Support for the liberal alternative was strongest on the question of peer reviews, with 75 per cent in favor of such reviews under a NHI program. Differentiation in the profession is considerable. Main activity, work setting, specialty, percentage of income in salary, geographical location, and career stage all contribute to differing reactions to NHI among physicians.},

This is a book about physicians' attitudes toward political and health care issues. The authors examine how physicians feel about various issues such as the expanding role of government, the financing of medical care through third-party payment, the increasingly formal organization of medical practice, the review of physicians' performance, the reimbursement of physicians with salary and fixed fees replacing fee-for-service and the increasing specialization of health manpower. Their findings
derive from two surveys, one a longitudinal study conducted from I964
to 1970 of New York State private practitioners prior to and following
the enactment of Medicare, the other conducted in I973 on a national
sample of physicians, house officers and medical students.
The book covers the following: a brief discussion of problems and
trends in health care along with a more detailed description of physicians'
attitudest owardt hesei ssues;a n analysiso f physicians's ocial background
and professional characteristicsa nd how these variablesa re related to
physicians' attitudes; studies of attitude change between generations of
physicians and following historical events such as the enactment of Medicare;
and finally a discussion on whether organized medicine represents
the opinion of rank and file physicians.
Though the data are dated, the book is interestings ince it is not purely
descriptive but introduces important sociological concepts in attempting
to explain what influences physicians' attitudes. Different sources of influence
are examined, including those related to earlier sources of socialization
as reflected by physicians' social characteristics such as socioeconomic
and religious-ethnicb ackgrounda nd gender,a nd laters ources
of socialization as reflected by physicians' professional characteristics
such as medical specialty and work setting. The distinctive influences of
age, cohort and period effects in shaping physicians' attitudes are also
examined as well as the extent to which selection, more than socialization,
is the determining factor in explaining physicians' attitudes. These
analyses however are limited, as Colombotos and Kirchner mention, by
the cross-sectional design of their data which means that some of their
conclusions must be taken with caution, particularly when they write
that "socialization has a stronger effect on attitudes of physicians than
does their original selection of work setting and specialty." Their argument
is not convincing.
Although some of the findings have been published before in various
articles, this book offers an in-depth analysis of who physicians are and
why they think as they do. It constitutes a major contribution to this
field of research. It is very well written and easy to read, which makes it
accessible to a wide range of students and professionals in the social
sciences and the health care field.

This may be due to a direct response of instrumentally motivated voters, but recent theoretical work casts doubt on the adequacy of this explanation. Another possibility is that elite actors respond to closeness with greater effort at mobilization. We explore the latter possibility by using FEC and state data on campaign expenditures in House, Senate, and gubernatorial races. Our results indicate that closeness has an effect at both the mass and elite levels. We also provide quantitative estimates of the effect of Senate and gubernatorial expenditure on House turnout. },

However, the data-generating process for cosponsorship is untheorized and little studied. We examine the properties of ideal point estimates from cosponsorship data.

Following models of boundedly rational candidates, we argue that there is strong reason to believe that the opposite is true. As the complexity of the electoral landscape increases, challengers will have a more difficult time locating an optimal platform when facing an experienced incumbent. Using data from the 2000 National Annenberg Election Study, we construct a novel measure of district complexity for U.S. House districts and test whether the entry of quality challengers and the incumbent's share of the two-party vote are affected by the complexity of the electoral landscape. We find strong support for the hypothesis that complexity benefits incumbents for both indicators of electoral competition, which stands in contrast to most of the existing literature on diversity and incumbent performance.},

  Abstract                 = { For more than two decades political scientists have discussed rising elite polarization in the United States, but the study of mass polarization did not receive comparable attention until fairly recently. This article surveys the literature on mass polarization. It begins with a discussion of the concept of polarization, then moves to a critical consideration of different kinds of evidence that have been used to study polarization, concluding that much of the evidence presents problems of inference that render conclusions problematic. The most direct evidence—citizens' positions on public policy issues—shows little or no indication of increased mass polarization over the past two to three decades. Party sorting—an increased correlation between policy views and partisan identification—clearly has occurred, although the extent has sometimes been exaggerated. Geographic polarization—the hypothesized tendency of like-minded people to cluster together—remains an open question. To date, there is no conclusive evidence that elite polarization has stimulated voters to polarize, on the one hand, or withdraw from politics, on the other. },

  Abstract                 = {In the \{US\} House and Senate, each piece of legislation is sponsored by a unique legislator. In addition, legislators can publicly express support for a piece of legislation by cosponsoring it. The network of sponsors and cosponsors provides information about the underlying social networks among legislators. I use a number of statistics to describe the cosponsorship network in order to show that it behaves much differently than other large social networks that have been recently studied. In particular, the cosponsorship network is much denser than other networks and aggregate features of the network appear to be influenced by institutional arrangements and strategic incentives. I also demonstrate that a weighted closeness centrality measure that I call ‘connectedness’ can be used to identify influential legislators. },

The findings reveal that, while a relatively large number of members expend effort in the legislative realm and have some success, this group can still be identified as a unique subset, which is only partially specified by the conventional wisdom defining congressional power holders. The analysis also points to the conclusion that legislative effort and success do not contribute to electoral strength and security. Legislating is an option largely reserved for those members with few electoral fears.},

  Abstract                 = {The United States recently has debated how to impose an "expenditure cap" or "expenditure target" on all spending for health or for physicians' services alone. European and Canadian experiences demonstrate the meaning, methods of administration, and pitfalls of these limits: caps are fixed sums within which all service must be provided; if cost overruns loom before the end of the year, benefits are denied or provider prices are reduced. Although organized financing systems can impose caps on hospitals, the medical profession rarely allows them. Rather, annual expenditure targets are becoming common in the physicians' sector. Following this blueprint, if predicted costs are exceeded in a year, reimbursement increases are less generous the following year. Medical associations always insist on negotiating limits and participating in their implementation. Government attempts to dictate these arrangements have never been successful. This article describes the details of setting and implementing limits.},

  Review                   = {Down the street from Ball State's campus, we have a 24-hour, 365-day-a year medical clinic run by an MBA who hires doctors on a salary basis and charges non-insured (and some insured) customers $37.50 for each visit, paidby cash, check, or credit card. If I was an English citizen, I could walk into thenationalized National Health Service clinics as frequently as I like, with the tab picked up by general treasury funds and payroll taxes. If I was a Frenchcitizen, I would go to a private health clinic, but my bill would be paid by themandatory National Health Insurance program financed with payroll taxes, twothirdspaid by the employer and one-third paid by the employee. If I were a German citizen, I would go to private clinics, but my bill would be paid by themandatory purchase of private insurance, which collects actuarial-basedpremiums from me. If I were a Swiss citizen, I would go to private clinics,paid for with the voluntary purchase of private insurance, which collectsactuarial-based premiums from me. In Italy, I would go to nationalized government-operated and funded clinics. In the Netherlands and Belgium, mandatory participation in public or private insurance funds finances healthservices. These are some of the health insurance financing arrangements described in William Glaser's Health Insurance in Practice.
Glaser does a comprehensive, organized, and voluminous job describing thehistorical evolution, consequences, and current practices of financing healthcare in western Europe and North America. To his credit, Glaser interviewed several hundred health financing officials in nine countries. Since starting his health financing research agenda in the 1960s, he and his book impressively document a deep and up-to-date reading program on the subject of health care. A novice-or expert-in health care finance would be wise to read this well written book.
Glaser's knowledge of the subject and strength in describing existing institutions and practices does not translate into non-debatable policy recommendations, however. A political scientist himself, Glaser laments the success of health care policy analysis from neoclassical economists.
During the 1970s, health policy analysis in the United States was captured by neoclassical welfare economists. Those who advocated social solidarity, redistributive finance, and generous insurance were eclipsed. To the new economists, the problem was to make the health care sector more efficient and to assign it an appropriate place insociety's priorities. This could be achieved by a competitive market in which a well informedand self-interested consumer made rational choices among providers, drove hard bargains, and maximized his savings. When health care suffered from market failure, the culprit was over-insurance among employed groups and in Medicare. People could be rational consumers: they patronized wasteful providers and over-utilized services because they did not buy their own insurance and did not use enough of their own cash in paying providers (pp. 419-420).
As a rule of thumb, and in health care specifically, Glaser distrusts the ability of competition and free markets to produce high quality services at low prices. The problem with a free market, Glaser says, is that everyone pursues his own self-interest at everyone else's expense. Glaser's bias is in favor of mandatory payroll tax-financed national health insurance roughly (but not perfectly) similar to the French system or the U.S. Social Security system. Among the European models for health insurance, the Swiss and German models allow forthe most competition among private providers. Glaser's proposals for the United States call for more redistribution, more subsidies, and more government involvement than most of the European models he uses as supporting evidence for his U.S. proposals. The Swiss and German systems in particular,which he admires, bear little resemblance to his payroll-tax-based proposals forthe United States. A reader might suspect that the European evidence was notcentral to his U.S. policy conclusions which were probably formed long ago. Using Glaser's descriptions of European health insurance practice, another reader could make policy conclusions diametrically opposed to Glaser's. The Swiss and German experience of individuals or families-not employers-purchasing actuarial-based policies might be argued to confirm the economist's point-of-view, not Glaser's.
Neoclassical economist Martin Feldstein favors restricting all-or mandatory-health insurance to catastrophic coverage. If insurance was catastrophic,everyone would have to self-insure themselves for small losses. With mandatory catastrophic insurance, consumers would be free to supplement the catastrophic coverage if they wish, contract with cost-conscious but choice limiting health maintenance organizations (HMOs), or self-insure the remaining small losses. Governing health care costs by the same market pressures as otherproducts in other industries, Feldstein hopes that such a proposal would provideincentives to contain costs. In contrast, Glaser proposes to contain health care costs through collective negotiations, rate regulation, and government oversight. Observing the high number of uninsured and the high health care costs in the United States, both Feldstein and Glaser agree that the current mosaic of healthcare financing arrangements in the United States have failed because of "government-failure" or "market-failure".
Despite potential policy differences from economists, Glaser has produced an excellent, straightforward account of health insurance as it is now practiced in western Europe. The institutional research of this political scientist is valuable, and anyone-including economists-would be wise to augment their reading lists with a book like Glaser's to improve our usually inadequate knowledge of existing institutional arrangements. Second, he has ably presented his non-market-oriented viewpoint on how to solve the failure of the U.S. health financing system. If competition is good for health insurance, competition among ideas is also good for the critical and on-going public policy debate over health insurance. In this light, Glaser's non-market-oriented viewpoint is also welcomed to sharpen the proposals of his opponents or his like-thinking brethren.

  Review                   = {This is a truly noteworthy contribution to the literature of medical care and medical econom ics. It is an amazing book in that it could not be more timely, yet the necessary research has taken the author 10 years to complete. Glaser combines a degree of scholarly investigation seldom encountered with a most readable style. Furthermore, he has provided an excellent in? dex and a useful summary at the end of each chapter. This reviewer, faced with 311 pages of text, each page larded with footnotes, thought she could skim through it, but soon became so interested that the entire text was read.
Seeking answers to the question "If doctors are paid by one or another method, what is the difference in how the public is treated? Glaser visited 16 countries in Europe and the Near East, exploring physician remuneration in each. He collected both opinions and statistics, consulting with an astounding number of persons (240 in all), and visited from two to 10 hospitals in each country. Furthermore, he read widely in the field. The authors referenced amount to a Who's Who of medical economics, at least in the United States and probably in each of the countries visited: Cyprus, Egypt, France, Great Britain, West Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the U.S.S.R.
The book opens with a useful description of organized systems of medical care, including both national health insurance and a national health service. This sets the stage for examining the types of physician payment used in the different countries, as well as the historical and political framework of the particular payment methods.
Six variations of fee-for-service payments to physicians are identified in Chapter 3, including service and cash benefits. The effects on use and costs, and the dilemmas facing the legislative and administrative bodies are described.
The fourth chapter examines the salary approach to paying doctors. Glaser discusses its effect on recruitment and on doctors' prestige, and connects these to the extent of the salaried service (either all physicians, or as in Britain, those connected with hospitals), and the economy of the country.
Chapters 5 and 10 are "must" reading for the growing group of medical care professionals who advocate capitation as the one solution that will encourage good care, prevent abuse, discourage neglect and so forth. Glaser was able to find little demonstrable evidence that there was more preventive care for example, under capitation. He examines the arrangements in Great Britain, the Netherlands and Spain and finds that the length of the physician's list and how to supplement it in sparsely settled areas are constant problems. Negotiations over the amount of the capitation payment create conflicts, according to the author. "Capitation pleases administrators and budget officers"; "The rates can differ by types of patient, in order to compensate for the more time-consuming patient" (as is the procedure with prepaid group practice plans under Medicare in the United States). In Spain there is an effort to control income by manipulating the size of the lists.
Capitation is not widely used, and is usually (except in Spain) confined to general practitioners. In Chapter 10 Glaser concludes that gross neglect of patients does not occur. How? ever, he notes it provides "no pecuniary motives for more effort or for work of better quality." "Capitation tends to reinforce the distinction between the general practitioner and specialist by depriving each of the finan? cial motives to perform the other's procedures." Where general practitioners aspire to upward mobility and greater development of skills, it is not popular.
In Chapter 7 the author examines the service benefit forms of fee-for-service practice. He points out that service benefits arrangements where the provider is paid directly by the insurance fund are more vulnerable to the performance of unnecessary work and to the fraudulent submission of claims for work not actually done than are arrangements where the patient is cognizant of the billing. Competition among funds, as in Switzerland, may keep payments per procedure low and thereby induce performance of repetitive procedures to increase income. The necessary fast pace of seeing patients mitigates against preventive medicine and reinforces the physicians' preoccupation with clinical therapy.
A pitfall of the German approach is that any doctor can be paid for any procedure in the fee schedule; he tends to hang on to his patients and perform work beyond his capacity. Thus continuity of care (desirable) results? but at a price. Few fee-for-service schemes are designed to encourage referrals.
Another danger is the underdevelopment of essential specialties that may result from un derpricing some fees. Holland and Sweden avoid having unqualified men do specialist procedures by not providing payments for such services?the salaried specialists in the public hospitals are the resource for advanced pro? cedures.
Fee-for-service is believed to encourage the gravitation of doctors to the cities; besides a larger potential patient load, higher fees are often paid to those in urban practice.
In the last analysis, Glaser finds that how fee-for-service works depends on the prosper ity and ethics of the medical profession in a given country. But, since the doctor's income depends on whatever problems patients present to him and patients under these schemes are seldom tied to a given doctor, compared to other approaches doctors under fee-for-service must, more often, cater to patients.
Chapter 8 carries the analysis of fee-for service further, looking at cash indemnity schemes. Many of the pros and cons are identical with the service benefit fee-for-service plans. An inherent problem is that, since the insurance system does not deal with the provider, any refusal to pay unwarranted claims penalizes the patient, not the doctor. It is Utopian, however, for the medical profession to view the cash indemnity approach as a way to leave the doctor-patient relationship completely unregulated in the private market place, while the patient's relations with the source of money to pay the provider are a regulated public transaction.
The chapter dealing with the effects of salaries explores all sides of this method of payment. One advantage is that the salary approach does not encourage unnecessary work; on the other hand, it may encourage sloppy performance, especially where the national scheme does not allow the patient to get several opinions at the plan's expense. The system can promote better distribution of physicians to help solve rural shortages; however, it can also raise the problem of income parity. In the U.S.S.R. physicians were originally placed on a salary scale below professionals essential to industrialization of the nation. In later years, their status has improved; but they are still not at the top of the hierarchy, as in most countries. Maintaining income parity is a constant problem in all countries with physicians on salary: "every profession thinks it is underpaid"; and medicine is as vocal as any other profession.
The whole of Chapter 9 is fascinating reading and the reviewer is tempted to cite exten? sively. Cross-national differences in salaries, for example, can cause emigration. The salary approach is the most amenable to the rational planning of allocation and movement of doctors. Furthermore, a salary scheme has not had an inhibiting effect on entry of students into a nation's medical schools. In summary, the traditions and medical organization of a coun? try determine whether use of salaries is associated with excellence of mediocrity.
Perhaps the most important message of the book is this:
Throughout the world, professionals are increasingly subject to public regulations, or to rules that are conditions for participation in extensive public programs, and increasing numbers of professionals work in organizations. Doctors, like all other professionals encountering these trends, need to reconcile their customary self-image of total autonomy with the new requirements of organizational and social responsibility. Their need for discretion must be combined with the organizations' needs for stability and predictability ; collaborative decisionmaking and amicable relations must be created with lay administrators, new habits must be learned, such as remembering rules, filling out forms conscientiously, and following orderly time schedules.

In some respects doctors share the conservative values of other American social elites, but in others they may differ and may be predisposed to a peculiarly professional belief system. Doctors' distinctive orientations toward politics follow from the characteristics typical of a very successful social elite and of a highly developed profession whose special tasks, knowledge, methods, and work routines are very different from the ordinary work of government.},

Drawing on data from three original vignette experiments embedded in a nationally representative survey of American adults, we find that respondents are reluctant to blame or deny societal support in response to explicit cues about racial attributes — but equally explicit cues about the causal impact of individual behaviors on health have large effects on expressed attitudes. Across all three experiments, a focus on individual behavioral causes of illness is associated with increased support for individual responsibility for health care costs and lower support for government-financed health insurance. Beliefs about social groups and causal attributions are, however, tightly intertwined. We find that when groups suffering ill health are defined in racial, class, or gender terms, Americans differ in their attribution of health disparities to individual behaviors versus biological or systemic factors. Because causal attributions also affect health policy opinions, varying patterns of causal attribution may reinforce group stereotypes and undermine support for universal access to health care.},

  Abstract                 = {This article extends the Calvert-Wittman candidate-location model by allowing one candidate to have a valence advantage over the other, due to, say, superior character, charisma, name recognition, or intelligence. Under some fairly weak assumptions, I show that when one candidate has a small advantage over the other, this alters equilibrium policy positions in two ways. First, it causes the disadvantaged candidate to move away from the center. Second, and perhaps more surprising, it causes the advantaged candidate to move toward the center. I also show that, under some fairly weak assumptions, for all levels of the valence advantage, the advantaged candidate chooses a more moderate position than the disadvantaged candidate. Empirical studies of congressional elections by Fiorina (1973), and Ansolabehere, Snyder, and Stewart (2001) support this result.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT This article examines the recent pattern and progress of health care reform in affluent democracies, focusing in particular on Britain, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States. Its main contention is that efforts to reform health care in advanced industrial states have been marked by a paradoxical pattern of 'reform without change and change without reform,' in which large-scale structural reforms have had surprisingly modest effects yet major ground-level shifts have, nonetheless, frequently occurred as a result of decentralized adjustments to cost control. The main task of the article is to investigate the reasons for and effects of this puzzling pattern by plumbing the largely unexplored theoretical territory between comparative health policy analysis and cross-national research on the welfare state. Along the way, the article develops a simple model of the politics of reform that helps explain cross-national variation in legislative and policy outcomes – particularly outcomes that occur through decentralized processes of internal policy 'conversion' and policy 'drift,' rather than through formal legislative reform. It also takes up a number of other intriguing issues raised by recent trends: why, for example, market reforms are clustered in centralized political and medical frameworks; why these reforms have generally enhanced state authority rather than market autonomy&semi; why, despite fragmentation, decentralized political and medical systems shifted towards an expanded government role&semi; and why significant retrenchment of the public-private structure of health benefits occurred in the United States. },

We argue that the number of LGB constituents in a district affects the representatives’ behavior. Although the size of the LGB population positively affects the substantive representation members provide to their LGB constituents, population is conditioned by majority public opinion on LGB issues in determining members’ low-cost, symbolic representation of LGB constituents. More favorable majority attitudes toward the minority allow the member to provide more symbolic representation to LGB constituents through low-cost gestures and actions. Statistical tests examining the effects of minority population and public opinion on House members’ voting records, bill sponsorships and cosponsorships, and caucus memberships from 2005 to 2011 provide support for our hypotheses.},

Conflicting results in studies of legislative representation are frequently attributed to issue salience or subconstituency politics. However, most conclusions about the effect of issue salience rely on studies of responsiveness on issues held to be either important or visible. Consequently, we have little idea of how changes in salience serve to alter the representational relationship. To examine this question, we employ a natural experiment to exploit the sudden increase in issue visibility surrounding the consideration of the Armenian Genocide Resolution. We are unable to detect any evidence that salience (as measured by visibility) enhances responsiveness to majority preferences. Instead, salience appears to alter legislators’ sensitivity to different intense subconstituency groups in their districts.},

While the partisan divide on this issue is stark among political elites, it is less clear how the mass electorate has responded to this divisive conflict. In this article we examine individual-level dynamics in health care attitudes between 2008 and 2010. We find partisan attachments and self-interests strongly predict change in health care attitudes, with Republicans growing more opposed to universal health insurance between 2008 and 2010, and those personally worried about medical expenses less likely to abandon support. We find, however, that the effect of partisanship is moderated by self-interest, with strong Republicans significantly less likely to switch to opposition if they were personally worried about medical expenses. Finally, we find that health care policy preferences, already tinged with racial attitudes in 2008, became increasingly so by 2010.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Scholarly research has demonstrated rather conclusively that American political elites have undergone a marked partisan polarization over the past thirty years. There is less agreement, however, as to whether the American electorate is polarized. This review article evaluates the evidence, causes and consequences of polarization on both the elite and mass levels. A marked difference between the two is found. Elites are polarized by almost any definition, although this state of affairs is quite common historically. In contrast, mass attitudes are now better sorted by party, but generally not polarized. While it is unclear whether this potentially troubling disconnect between centrist mass attitudes and extreme elite preferences has negative policy consequences, it appears that the super-majoritarian nature of the US Senate serves as a bulwark against policy outcomes that are more ideologically extreme than the public would prefer. Moreover, a public more centrist than those who represent it has also at times exerted a moderating influence on recent policies. },

After evaluating both indicators in terms of validity and reliability, the analysis suggests that the district-level indicator is both empirically and intuitively superior as a measure of electoral competition.

We address several questions regarding party mobilization efforts. Whom do the parties seek to mobilize? What are the individual and aggregate characteristics and criteria that shape party mobilization efforts? What are the intended and unintended consequences of partisan mobilization, both for individual voters and for the electorate more generally? In answering these questions we make several arguments. First, party efforts at electoral mobilization inevitably depend upon a process of social diffusion and informal persuasion, so that the party canvass serves as a catalyst aimed at stimulating a cascading mobilization process. Second, party mobilization is best seen as being environmentally contingent upon institutional arrangements, locally defined strategic constraints, and partisan divisions within particular electorates. Finally, the efforts of party organizations generate a layer of political structure within the electorate that sometimes competes with social structure and often exists independently from it. },

  Abstract                 = {Six years after the Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law, the number of nonelderly Americans with health insurance has expanded by twenty million, and the uninsurance rate has declined nearly 9 percentage points. Nevertheless, public opinion about the law remains deeply divided. We investigated how individuals may be experiencing and responding to health reform implementation by analyzing three waves of a panel study we conducted in 2010, 2012, and 2014. While public opinion about the ACA remains split (45.6 percent unfavorable and 36.2 percent favorable), there have been several detectable shifts. The share of respondents believing that reform had little or no impact on access to health insurance or medical care diminished by 18 percentage points from 2010 to 2014, while those considering reform to have some or a great impact increased by 19 percentage points. Among individuals who held unfavorable views toward the law in 2010, the percentage who supported repeal—while still high, at 72 percent—shrank by 9 percentage points from 2010 to 2014. We found that party affiliation and distrust in government were influential factors in explaining the continuing divide over the law. The ACA has delivered discernible benefits, and some Americans are increasingly recognizing that it is improving access to health insurance and medical care.},

We focus, instead, on “structural framing” to understand how institutionalized public health and health care policies impact public opinion and behavior over time. Understanding the dynamics of public opinion over time is especially helpful in tracking the political effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 as it moves from the debate over its passage to its implementation and operation.},

  Abstract                 = { By every measure, politics in Washington became increasingly polarized along partisan and ideological lines between the Nixon and George W. Bush (2001) administrations. One component of this development has been the growing partisan disparity in congressional support for presidential initiatives. This trend has a manifest electoral and popular basis. Survey and aggregate electoral data show that the extent to which presidents and members of the opposition party in Congress share electoral constituencies has declined significantly, and the parties' respective electoral bases have become increasingly polarized in terms of both ideology and presidential voting patterns. Presidential job approval data also show a widening gap in the average approval ratings expressed by self-identified Republicans and Democrats. These changes have substantially reduced incentives for opposition members to support the president, while making it politically more attractive for the president's own partisans to support his positions. If, as the evidence suggests, partisan differences in presidential support have sturdy electoral roots, they are likely to persist. The overwhelming bipartisan popular and congressional support initially enjoyed by George W. Bush after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 was unsustainable because it was not supported by a fundamental and durable change in mass political attitudes. },

If they are relatively fixed, do identifications move substantive issue preferences, perceptions of candidates, and perceptions of the link between candidates and issues? Early studies in the United States answered these questions in the affirmative. The track record for other systems is spotty, and each question occasioned repeated controversy in the decades since the 1960s. Much of the apparent lability and cross-national variation in party ties can be laid at the feet of measurement error, but not all. The claim that party identification moves other features on the political landscape is remarkably robust. },

  Abstract                 = {We develop a new approach to the study of representation based on agenda setting and attention allocation. We ask the fundamental question: do the policy priorities of the public and of the government correspond across time? To assess the policy priorities of the mass public, we have coded the Most Important Problem data from Gallup polls across the postwar period into the policy content categories developed by the Policy Agendas Project (Baumgartner & Jones, 2002). Congressional priorities were assessed by the proportion of total hearings in a given year focusing on those same policy categories, also from the Agendas Project. We then conducted similar analyses on public laws and most important laws, similarly coded. Finally we analyzed the spatial structure of public and congressional agendas using the Shepard-Kruskal non-metric multidimensional scaling algorithm. Findings may be summarized as follows: First, there is an impressive congruence between the priorities of the public and the priorities of Congress across time. Second, there is substantial evidence of congruence between the priorities of the public and lawmaking in the national government, but the correspondence is attenuated in comparison to agendas. Third, although the priorities of the public and Congress are structurally similar, the location of issues within the structure differs between Congress and the general public. The public "lumps" its evaluation of the nations most important problems into a small number of categories. Congress "splits" issues out, handling multiple issues simultaneously. Finally, the public tends to focus on a very constrained set of issues, but Congress juggles many more issues. The article has strong implications for the study of positional representation as well, because for traditional representation to occur, there must be correspondence between the issue-priorities of the public and the government. We find substantial evidence for such attention congruence here.},

In this note, we argue that there is theoretically interesting heterogeneity in risk attitudes among the mass public- heterogeneity that has important electoral consequences. We hypothesize that risk-averse voters will be drawn to candidates who offer certainty and stability, whereas risk-accepting voters will be more willing to support candidates characterized by uncertainty and change. Utilizing data from the 2008-2009 ANES Panel Study, we show that individual risk attitudes significantly influence support for challenger candidates in the 2008 U.S. House races. We then unpack this empirical relationship between risk attitudes and willingness to support challenger candidates using two additional data sets. These supplementary analyses suggest that the relationship between risk attitudes and willingness to support challengers may be partly attributable to the fact that challengers represent a departure from the status quo and typically have less governing experience. In short, challengers represent a gamble that the more risk accepting are more willing to take.},

Sensitive to the odds that nonoccupational groups face, this study asks what factors have allowed patient groups to form and become active in federal politics. Using three distinct data sets - a survey of patient groups, content analysis of group websites, and in-depth interviews with group representatives and policy makers in Washington, DC - this study assesses the activities of patient groups in the United States and argues that patient advocacy organizations garner stability from the relatively easy provision of selective and solidary benefits. Larger patient groups are especially likely to make use of these structural advantages to pursue congressional lobbying strategies. However, even these groups seek out noncompetitive, distributive political environments. Moreover, the study finds that patient groups rarely form coalitions across diseases, forgoing the potential to collectively speak for shared patient interests.},

I propose an alternative method that employs multiple election returns to estimate voters’ ideological distributions within districts. I develop two estimation procedures—a least squared error model and a Bayesian model—and test each with simulations and empirical applications. The models are shown to outperform vote shares, and they are validated with direct measures of voter ideology and out-of-sample election predictions. Beyond estimating district ideology, these models provide valuable information on constituency heterogeneity—an important, but often immeasurable, quantity for research on representatives’ strategic behavior.},

The first part deals solely with hospitals in state ownership, but the study moves later onto the problems of ownership relations as well. The question posed is why the SBC phenomenon is so general in the hospital sector (including specialist outpatient clinics and diagnostic or nursing establishments that operate as separate units). The study contains several references to Hungarian experience, but the subject is of a more general nature. The SBC phenomenon is not confined to the Hungarian hospital sector, nor to the socialist system, nor as a vestige of socialism during post-socialist transformation. Soft budget constraints inevitably develop in the hospital sector, even in capitalist market economies.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of the budget constraint, previously applied mainly to household decisions, was extended to enterprises and other organizations initially by Kornai for socialist economies. The more general phenomenon usually includes rent seeking, although not all rent-seeking behavior is associated with a soft budget constraint (SBC). Rather, \{SBC\} analysis is a theory of exit, or more precisely, of the demise of organizations. Moreover, the syndrome cannot be treated as a special case of the theory of regulation because not all price regulation softens the budget constraint. The \{SBC\} can emerge in nonregulated spheres, especially when financial interactions take place in vertical relationships between superiors and subordinates rather than in horizontal market conditions.J.

Using data from the 99th Congress, this article assesses the degree to which significant party behaviour - defined and operationalized as behaviour that is independent of preferences - occurs in two key stages of legislative organization: the formation of standing committees and the appointment of conferees. Four hypotheses are developed and tested. When controlling for preferences and other hypothesized effects, positive and significant party effects are rare. A discussion addresses some criticisms of this unorthodox approach and attempts to reconcile some differences between these and previous findings.},

  Abstract                 = {According to a number of social psychological theories, attitudes toward government policies that people consider important should have substantial impact on presidential candidate preferences, and unimportant attitudes should have relatively little impact. Surprisingly, the accumulated evidence evaluating this hypothesis offers little support for it. This article reexamines the hypothesis, applying more appropriate analysis methods to data collected during the 1968, 1980, and 1984 American presidential election campaigns. The impact of policy attitudes on candidate preferences was indeed found to depend on the importance of those attitudes, just as theory suggests. The analysis also documented two mechanisms of this increased impact: People for whom a policy attitude is important perceive larger differences between competing candidates' attitudes, and important attitudes appear to be more accessible in memory than unimportant ones.

  Abstract                 = {``Winnowing'' is the pre-floor process by which Congress determines the small percentage of bills that will receive committee attention. The vast majority of proposals languish in this vital agenda-setting stage, yet our understanding of winnowing is nascent. Why do some bills move forward while most fail? I examine that question here by developing and testing a theoretical framework of winnowing grounded in bounded rationality, which includes institutional and sponsor cues and also incorporates the unique issue milieu. A heteroskedastic probit model is utilized to analyze the winnowing fate of all bills introduced across five issue areas in the House and Senate from 1991 to 1998. The findings counter much received wisdom and suggest that the process is indeed cue based. The majority party helps structure this critical process in both chambers, though party effects appear stronger in the House. Contrary to recent work on the rise of Senate individualism, the seniority of the sponsor has significant effects in both the Senate and House, but again exhibits a stronger effect in the House. Surprisingly, presidential proposals are no more likely to survive than typical bills. The findings further suggest that the entrepreneurial efforts of bill sponsors breathe life into this process.},

To do so, I adapt the theory of citizen retrospective voting to congress members’ roll-call voting. This new theory also provides a missing link in many studies of ideological shirking and democratic accountability. I test and confirm the theory of retrospective roll-call voting for the current period of ideological polarization, 1970 to 2008. As such, I argue that the recent trend of vanishing marginals has been a contributing cause in the recent trend of ideological polarization in the U.S. House. },

It examines the impact of elite and grass roots lobbying, in addition to the influence of campaign contributions. The results show that, at least on this issue, the NRA's and Handgun Control's prevote campaign contributions affected member's subsequent votes, even when other variables, including ideology, member's prior position, and constituency characteristics, are held constant. Handgun Control's monetary contributions had a statistically marginal impact, but their lobbying effort, along with that of the police, was clearly successful, while NRA's was not. The paper suggests some reasons why contributions appear to have had an impact on congressional voting even for a salient issue.},

We present the first systematic assessment of the predictive accuracy of each and give practical advice about when and how each method should be used. To do so, we use an original data set of over 100 surveys on gay rights issues as well as 1988 presidential election data. Under optimal conditions, both methods work well, but multilevel modeling performs better generally. Compared to baseline opinion measures, it yields smaller errors, higher correlations, and more reliable estimates. Multilevel modeling is clearly superior when samples are smaller—indeed, one can accurately estimate state opinion using only a single large national survey. This greatly expands the scope of issues for which researchers can study subnational opinion directly or as an influence on policymaking.},

Using national surveys and advances in opinion estimation, we create new estimates of state-level support for eight policies, including civil unions and nondiscrimination laws. We differentiate between responsiveness to opinion and congruence with opinion majorities. We find a high degree of responsiveness, controlling for interest group pressure and the ideology of voters and elected officials. Policy salience strongly increases the influence of policy-specific opinion (directly and relative to general voter ideology). There is, however, a surprising amount of noncongruence—for some policies, even clear supermajority support seems insufficient for adoption. When noncongruent, policy tends to be more conservative than desired by voters; that is, there is little progay policy bias. We find little to no evidence that state political institutions affect policy responsiveness or congruence. },

  Abstract                 = {A long with the traditional "promissory" form of representation, empirical political scientists have recently analyzed several new forms, called here "anticipatory," "gyroscopic," and "surrogate" representation. None of these more recently recognized forms meets the criteria for democratic accountability developed for promissory representation, yet each generates a set of normative criteria by which it can be judged. These criteria are systemic, in contrast to the dyadic criteria appropriate for promissory representation. They are deliberative rather than aggregative. They are plural rather than singular.},

  Abstract                 = {The capacity of a politicalsystem to respond to the preferences of its citizens is centralto democratic theory and practice. Research and theory about the impact of public opinion on policy making in the United States, however, have produced decidedly mixed views. A number of analysts find a strong and persisting impact of public opinion on public policy. Others reject the idea that the public has consistent views at all or, even if it does, that those views exercise much influence over policy making. In this article, we evaluate the state of the art in the debates over the opinion-policy link in the rapidly growing body of research on public opinion and policy making. After an extensive review and critique of the theoretical and empirical research developing “strong” and “weak” effect views of the impact of opinion on policy, we conclude that a third “contingent” view, highlighting the historical, institutional, and political contingencies, provides the best understanding of the impact of opinion on policy.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT There is a remarkable consensus that American medical care---particularly its financing and insurance coverage—needs a major overhaul. The critical unanimity on this point---what Paul Starr has rightly termed a "negative consensus"---bridges almost all the usual cleavages in American politics---between old and young, Democrats and Republicans, management and labor, the well paid and the low paid. We spend more on and feel worse about medical care than our economic competitors, with nine out of ten Americans (including Fortune 500 executives) telling pollsters that our health system requires substantial change. That is the good news for medical reformers in the Clinton administration, the Congress, and the polity at large. The bad news for these reformers is that, for a variety of ideological and institutional reasons, American politics makes it very difficult to coalesce around a solution that reasonably satisfies the requirements for a stable and workable system of financing and delivering modern medical care. We have no assurance that the rare agreement on the seriousness of the nation's medical ills will generate the legislative support required for a substantively adequate and administratively workable program of reform.},

They assert that Medicare can remain fiscally viable in the next century only by embracing a voucher system and exposing beneficiaries to the economic consequences of their medical care decisions. We argue here, however, that Medicare need not rely on vouchers or on placing financial incentives on individual beneficiaries to control costs. Instead, we contend that Medicare can control expenditures the way most other industrial democracies do: through budgetary caps and centralized regulation of provider payments.},

  Abstract                 = {This literature review pursues two main objectives: first, it argues that research on health policy actors and healthcare systems need to be separated more thoroughly. Though there are important interactions between both fields, it is often advisable to separate analytically research on health policy actors and on healthcare systems. Second, concentrating not only on actors and institutions but also on outcomes, we suggest, is theoretically valuable, practically feasible, and policy relevant. Most studies discussed in this review concentrate either on health policy implementation or on healthcare system characteristics. Our emphasis is on extending the understanding about the outcomes of different national healthcare arrangements and whether policy reforms actually deliver their promised results. To do this, more attention to the measurement of success is required.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Survey experiments have become a central methodology across the social sciences. Researchers can combine experiments’ causal power with the generalizability of population-based samples. Yet, due to the expense of population-based samples, much research relies on convenience samples (e.g. students, online opt-in samples). The emergence of affordable, but non-representative online samples has reinvigorated debates about the external validity of experiments. We conduct two studies of how experimental treatment effects obtained from convenience samples compare to effects produced by population samples. In Study 1, we compare effect estimates from four different types of convenience samples and a population-based sample. In Study 2, we analyze treatment effects obtained from 20 experiments implemented on a population-based sample and Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The results reveal considerable similarity between many treatment effects obtained from convenience and nationally representative population-based samples. While the results thus bolster confidence in the utility of convenience samples, we conclude with guidance for the use of a multitude of samples for advancing scientific knowledge. },

Democrats won the 2009-10 health reform battle by successfully applying lessons learned from past failures, including the importance of neutralizing interest-group opposition.

  Abstract                 = { Abstract: Politics, for better or worse, plays a critical role in health affairs. The purpose of this article is to articulate a role for political analysis of public health issues, ranging from injury and disease prevention to health care reform. It begins by examining how health problems make it onto the policy agenda. Perceptions regarding the severity of the problem, responsibility for the problem, and affected populations all influence governmental responses. Next, it considers how bounded rationality, fragmented political institutions, resistance from concentrated interests, and fiscal constraints usually lead political leaders to adopt incremental policy changes rather than comprehensive reforms even when faced with serious public health problems. It then identifies conditions under which larger-scale transformation of health policy can occur, focusing on critical junctures in policy development and the role of policy entrepreneurs in seizing opportunities for innovation. Finally, it reviews the challenges confronting officials and agencies who are responsible for implementing and administering health policies. Public health professionals who understand the political dimensions of health policy can conduct more realistic research and evaluation, better anticipate opportunities as well as constraints on governmental action, and design more effective policies and programs. },

Using a unique data set on state spending preferences on education and welfare, I find evidence of dynamic policy representation and dynamic public responsiveness, but with important qualifications. As state support for spending on education or welfare increases, state expenditures increase, but only for states that are highly professional and, presumably, able to accurately gauge the preferences of residents. In other states, legislators are responding to national policy sentiment instead of specific state opinion. I find no evidence that initiative states are more responsive to state opinion. Empirical evidence for dynamic public responsiveness is more consistent across model specifications. As state expenditures on education or welfare increase, state preferences for additional spending decrease, even after controlling for federal expenditures. Finally, I find that policy representation and public responsiveness in the states are conditional on issue saliency. The results provide a more nuanced understanding about the degree of dynamic representation and responsiveness in the states and the thermostatic model more generally.},

This approach combines the modeling approach often used in small-area estimation with the population information used in poststratification (see Gelman and Little 1997, Survey Methodology 23:127–135). To validate the method, we apply it to U.S. preelection polls for 1988 and 1992, poststratified by state, region, and the usual demographic variables. We evaluate the model by comparing it to state-level election outcomes. The multilevel model outperforms more commonly used models in political science. We envision the most important usage of this method to be not forecasting elections but estimating public opinion on a variety of issues at the state level.},

The question now is whether these landmark reforms will be consolidated and create a new politics going forward. We develop an argument about the limits of policy feedback to illuminate the obstacles to durable liberal reform in the contemporary American state. We argue that political scientists have paid insufficient attention to the fragility of inherited policy commitments, and that the capacity of reforms to remake politics is contingent, conditional, and contested. Feedbacks are shaped not only by the internal attributes of policies, but also by the interaction between policy-specific characteristics, the strategic goals of officeholders and clientele groups, and the political forces arising from a contentious and uncertain political environment. },

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Scholarship on electoral turnout has long emphasized two main themes: explanations of nonvoting in terms of individual characteristics and in terms of contextual variables. These investigations have deeply enriched our understanding of electoral participation, but their limitations have also sensitized us to the remaining problems of explanation. Perusal of the work on American politics exposes a rather striking tendency in studies of participation to ignore, or soft pedal, the effects of active political mobilization. In this article we formulate two models of electoral turnout—socioeconomic and political mobilization—and apply them to aggregate data on voting in gubernatorial elections of 1978 and 1980. The socioeconomic model of turnout includes such influences as income, age, and educational attainment. To assess the effects of political mobilization, we have considered campaign spending, partisan competition, electoral margin, and the presence or absence of a simultaneous race for the United States Senate. Both of the models perform quite well individually, producing significant and meaningful coefficients and adequate fits. Yet in the final analysis we demonstrate that quite apart from major sources of variation in gubernatorial turnout—such as region and presidential versus nonpresidential years—the mobilizing influences of campaign activism and competitiveness have a strong impact on electoral participation; electoral law, i.e., closing date of registration, retains a small but significant effect on voting for governor; and socioeconomic characteristics, included in a fully specified model, have little to contribute independently to an explanation of electoral turnout. These findings are very much in the same vein as related cross-national investigations, which emphasize the crucial role of electoral law and political parties and downplay individual characteristics as determinants of electoral participation. On the basis of the research reported here, we argue that scholars need to pay more attention to political mobilization as an explanation of electoral turnout. },

The discussion rarely produced a consensus because definitions of realignment are neither explicit nor theoretical, but historical and descriptive. This paper extends an argument which defines realignments as changes in the social group coalitions which distinguish party supporters. It uses this definition to describe changes which have been underway for over twenty years; it identifies the significance of the South in the transformation, and it shows the realignment to be programmatically significant even if the Democratic party retains its numerical dominance. },

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT It is increasingly common for social scientists to describe political processes as “path dependent.” The concept, however, is often employed without careful elaboration. This article conceptualizes path dependence as a social process grounded in a dynamic of “increasing returns.” Reviewing recent literature in economics and suggesting extensions to the world of politics, the article demonstrates that increasing returns processes are likely to be prevalent, and that good analytical foundations exist for exploring their causes and consequences. The investigation of increasing returns can provide a more rigorous framework for developing some of the key claims of recent scholarship in historical institutionalism: Specific patterns of timing and sequence matter; a wide range of social outcomes may be possible; large consequences may result from relatively small or contingent events; particular courses of action, once introduced, can be almost impossible to reverse; and consequently, political development is punctuated by critical moments or junctures that shape the basic contours of social life. },

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT As governmental activity has expanded, scholars have been increasingly inclined to suggest that the structure of public policies has an important influence on patterns of political change. Yet research on policy feedback is mostly anecdotal, and there has so far been little attempt to develop more general hypotheses about the conditions under which policies produce politics. Drawing on recent research, this article suggests that feedback occurs through two main mechanisms. Policies generate resources and incentives for political actors, and they provide those actors with information and cues that encourage particular interpretations of the political world. These mechanisms operate in a variety of ways, but have significant effects on government elites, interest groups, and mass publics. By investigating how policies influence different actors through these distinctive mechanisms, the article outlines a research agenda for moving from the current focus on illustrative case studies to the investigation of broader propositions about how and when policies are likely to be politically consequential. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper updates the findings in Congress: A Political-Economic History of Roll-Call Voting and compares them to findings for both European legislatures and the United Nations General Assembly. Congress argues that important episodes in American political and economic history can be better understood by supplementing or reinterpreting more traditional analyses with the basic space theory of ideology. In Congress, we measured ideology with D-NOMINATE scores. Here we summarize new estimations that are complete through the 105th Congress. We find that the trend to polarization and unidimensionality identified in Congress has continued unabated. The shift to Republican control after the 1994 elections is part of this trend and does not represent a sharp break in roll-call-voting behavior. Comparison of NOMINATE results for the United States to those for other legislatures both further indicates the ideological character of roll-call voting in Congress and suggests that low-dimensional spatial models apply as well to multiparty systems as to two-party systems.},

We observe that a decomposed roll-call record alters our view of the timing of changes in party polarization and therefore requires that we reconsider explanations of the trend. We revisit explanations of party polarization and establish a strong case for placing substantial emphasis on party strategies in explanations of party polarization in floor behavior during the 1980s and 1990s.},

As we explain, sponsoring and cosponsoring legislation are unique in that they are among the few activities outside the roll call arena that have both position taking and policy implications. We hypothesize that given minority legislators' lack of influence in Congress, they sponsor and cosponsor fewer bills than do nonminorities. We find support for our expectation; on average, Black and Latino legislators sponsor and cosponsor significantly fewer bills in Congress than do Whites and non-Latinos, respectively. But we also find the relationship to be contingent on which party controls Congress. Whereas Democratic Congresses encourage minorities' bill sponsorship and cosponsorship, Republican Congresses depress it. Because the concepts of participation and representation in Congress are so intimately tied to one another, these findings have a number of implications for the study of descriptive and substantive representation.},

Recent formal theory literature has contributed new insights into how parties choose platforms in countries with a continuum of heterogeneous districts. Meanwhile, increases in survey sample sizes and advances in empirical techniques have made it possible to characterize the distribution of preferences within and across electoral districts. This review addresses an emerging literature that builds on these new tools to explore the ways in which the geography of political preferences can help explain the parties that compete, the platforms and policies they choose, and even the rules under which they compete. Building on insights from economic and political geography, it pays special attention to electoral and policy biases that can emerge when there is an asymmetric distribution of preferences across districts. },

Our analysis avoids the pitfalls of prior studies by defining a simple, quasi-experimental, research design contrasting those certain that they are seeking reelection with those sure that they are departing the House for the 102nd, 103rd, and 104th Congresses (1991-1996). We measure changes in ideology and participation using all roll-call votes in the last six months of election years, controlling for possible member selection effects and short-term influences, and show that legislators are disposed toward ideological and participatory shirking while selection effects are unimportant. Thus, we reconcile results seemingly at odds and suggest that policies affecting member turnover, such as term limits, can interfere with representation.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Political scientists who are policy scholars often trace their lineage back to the pioneering work of Lerner and Lasswell (1951). But public policy did not emerge as a significant subfield within the discipline of political science until the late 1960s or early 70s. This resulted from at least three important stimuli: (1) social and political pressures to apply the profession's accumulated knowledge to the pressing social problems of racial discrimination, poverty, the arms race, and environmental pollution; (2) the challenge posed by Dawson and Robinson (1963), who argued that governmental policy decisions were less the result of traditional disciplinary concerns such as public opinion and party composition than of socioeconomic factors such as income, education, and unemployment levels; and (3) the efforts of David Easton, whose Systems Analysis of Political Life (1965) provided an intellectual framework for understanding the entire policy process, from demand articulation through policy formulation and implementation, to feedback effects on society. Over the past twenty years, policy research by political scientists can be divided into four types, depending upon the principal focus: 1. Substantive area research. This seeks to understand the politics of a specific policy area, such as health, education, transportation, natural resources, or foreign policy. Most of the work in this tradition has consisted of detailed, largely atheoretical, case studies. Examples would include the work of Derthick (1979) on social security, Moynihan (1970) on antipoverty programs, and Bailey and Mosher (1968) on federal aid to education. Such studies are useful to practitioners and policy activists in these areas, as well as providing potentially useful information for inductive theory building. In terms of the profession as a whole, however, they are probably less useful than theoretical case studies—such as Pressman and Wildavsky (1973) on implementation or Nelson (1984) on agenda-setting—which use a specific case to illustrate or test theories of important aspects of the policy process. 2. Evaluation and impact studies. Most evaluation research is based on contributions from other disciplines, particularly welfare economics (Stokey and Zeckhauser 1978; Jenkins-Smith 1990). Policy scholars trained as political scientists have made several contributions. They have broadened the criteria of evaluation from traditional social welfare functions to include process criteria, such as opportunities for effective citizen participation (Pierce and Doerksen, 1976). They have focused attention on distributional effects (MacRae, 1989). They have criticized traditional techniques of benefit-cost analysis on many grounds (Meier, 1984; MacRae and Whittington, 1988). Most importantly, they have integrated evaluation studies into research on the policy process by examining the use and non-use of policy analysis in the real world (Wildavsky, 1966; Dunn, 1980; Weiss, 1977). 3. Policy process. Two decades ago, both Ranney (1968) and Sharkansky (1970) urged political scientists interested in public policy to focus on the policy process, i.e. the factors affecting policy formulation and implementation, as well as the subsequent effects of policy. In their view, focusing on substantive policy areas risked falling into the relatively fruitless realm of atheoretical case studies, while evaluation research offered little promise for a discipline without clear normative standards of good policy. A focus on the policy process would provide opportunities for applying and integrating the discipline's accumulated knowledge concerning political behavior in various institutional settings. That advice was remarkably prescient; the first paper in this symposium attempts to summarize what has been learned. Policy design. With roots in the policy sciences tradition described by deLeon (1988), this approach has recently focused on such topics as the efficacy of different types of policy instruments (Salamon 1989; Linder and Peters 1989). Although some scholars within this orientation propose a quite radical departure from the behavioral traditions of the discipline (Bobrow and Dryzek 1987), others build upon work by policy-oriented political scientists over the past twenty years (Schneider and Ingram 1990) while Miller (1989) seeks to integrate political philosophy and the behavioral sciences. },

To account for variations among the states on the dimension of partisan competitiveness, we formulate and present four discrete lines of reasoning--including socio-demographics, urbanization, diversity, and the strength of party organizations. We test each of these avenues of explanation in turn, always taking into account the watershed between North and South in partisan competition. The results vindicate the utility of our general approach, although we do find that each of the four modes of explanation is wanting in some respect. In a full-blown multivariate context, we report that educational levels and urbanization do influence variations among states in partisan competition. Equally compelling and perhaps more interesting, the strength and activism of local party organizations in the states profoundly affect political competitiveness, even when we take stark regional differences into consideration.},

  Abstract                 = {The U.S. Congress enacted expansive (and expensive) health care reforms amid the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Public acquiescence provided crucial political cover; elites on both sides struggled mightily to sway popular opinion. Were reformers' efforts made easier or more difficult by the tough economic times? Using newly available data on Americans' perceptions of economic insecurity and attitudes toward public policy, this article explores the relationship between economic circumstances and political attitudes. The findings suggest that the Great Recession both facilitated and impeded efforts to rally the public in favor of reform: perceptions of past declines in the U.S. economy bolstered government intervention, but household economic insecurity both distracted attention from large medical expenses (which otherwise legitimized collective action) and undermined Americans' support for additional government spending. Equally consequential, reformers' efforts to adapt to economic stringency by portraying reform as exclusively about affordability missed opportunities for broadening popular support for these interventions; in the longer run this may, unless corrected, prove a decisive misstep in shepherding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act through its long time line of implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT We argue that the social construction of target populations is an important, albeit overlooked, political phenomenon that should take its place in the study of public policy by political scientists. The theory contends that social constructions influence the policy agenda and the selection of policy tools, as well as the rationales that legitimate policy choices. Constructions become embedded in policy as messages that are absorbed by citizens and affect their orientations and participation. The theory is important because it helps explain why some groups are advantaged more than others independently of traditional notions of political power and how policy designs reinforce or alter such advantages. An understanding of social constructions of target populations augments conventional hypotheses about the dynamics of policy change, the determination of beneficiaries and losers, the reasons for differing levels and types of participation among target groups, and the role of policy in democracy.},

  Abstract                 = {American state politics scholars have generally relied on Ranney’s measure of the partisan composition of state legislatures and governors’ offices to evaluate competition between parties for control of state government, and Holbrook and Van Dunk’s measure of the competitiveness of individual state legislative elections to evaluate the degree of electoral competition in a state. Both measure “competition” and were previously correlated with one another, so researchers might be tempted to consider them two measures of the same concept. This would be mistaken, however, because they are measuring two distinct concepts. We use new data on state legislative partisan balance and election returns to compute (and make publicly available) the two measures of competition from 1970 to 2003, a time span that is significantly longer than any previous study. We show that the relationship between the two measures has drastically changed over the last 30 years. Although the two measures were positively correlated in the 1970s and 1980s, they are now (as we might expect, given they are different concepts) negatively correlated. We investigate one possible explanation for this change and conclude by discussing a set of practical recommendations for scholars who plan to incorporate a measure of competition in future studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Although Canadians generally support their health care "model," dissatisfaction with health care policy and demands for fundamental changes in the system often surface in public opinion surveys. We seek to explain variations in levels of dissatisfaction and demands for health care reform with a series of micro- and macro-level analyses that account for a combination of individual experiences with health care delivery, broader measures of system performance, and media framing. Empirical analyses are guided by a model of opinion on policy that distinguishes between personal and collective, and prospective and retrospective assessments. This view helps make sense of the fact that those who use the system can have generally positive experiences even as there is decreasing confidence in the system's ability to meet future needs, and increasing demand for reform. What drives these divergent perceptions? We suggest that system performance plays a role in driving the long-term trend, but media content may also be an important driver as well, particularly for collective attitudes.},

  Abstract                 = {ABSTRACT This article analyzes the strategic use of public policy as a tool for reshaping public opinion. In the 1990s, “progressive revisionists” argued that, by reforming welfare, liberals could free the Democratic Party of a significant electoral liability, reduce the race-coding of poverty politics, and produce a public more willing to invest in anti-poverty efforts. Connecting this argument to recent scholarship on policy feedback, we pursue a quantitative case study of the potential for new policies to move public opinion. Our analysis reveals that welfare reform in the 1990s produced few changes in mass opinion. To explain this result, we propose a general framework for the analysis of mass feedback effects. After locating welfare as a “distant-visible” case in this framework, we advance four general propositions that shed light on our case-specific findings as well as the general conditions under which mass feedback effects should be viewed as more or less likely.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT If public opinion changes and then public policy responds, this is dynamic representation. Public opinion is the global policy preference of the American electorate. Policy is a diverse set of acts of elected and unelected officials. Two mechanisms of policy responsiveness are (1) elections change the government's political composition, which is then reflected in new policy and (2) policymakers calculate future (mainly electoral) implications of current public views and act accordingly (rational anticipation). We develop multiple indicators of policy activity for the House, Senate, presidency, and Supreme Court, then model policy liberalism as a joint function of the two mechanisms. For each institution separately, and also in a global analysis of “government as a whole,” we find that policy responds dynamically to public opinion change. This responsiveness varies by institution, both in level and in mechanism, as would be expected from constitutional design. },

  Abstract                 = {The broadly held view that promarket reforms are good for most people is in conflict with the equally broadly held view that, in democracies, reforms will generate widespread resistance. Resistance is expected because reforms typically produce economic downturns, at least over the short term. Under normal circumstances, we expect citizens to withdraw support from governments during periods of economic decline. If citizens withdraw support, then governments, worried about the next election, may abandon reforms. But our expectations should be different of new democracies pursuing promarket reforms. Citizens may believe governments when they claim that things have to get worse before they get better or that economic stagnation is the fault of the past model. Research in Poland, Peru, and Mexico, reported in this special issue, supports these expectations. Hence under democracy there is more scope for support of painful reforms than frequently acknowledged.},

The results from the analysis of voting patterns in the House of Representatives and the Senate are consistent with the hypotheses: Party line voting and variability of voting decisions decline with increasing seniority. Changes in voting behavior are also induced by redistricting. The empirical results show that legislators subject to redistricting change their voting behavior to accord better with altered constituency preferences. },

Previous empirical studies of the relative importance of ideology and self-interest in explaining attitudes and behavior have been conducted on general population samples. This is the first empirical test of the effects of these factors on the attitudes of professionals in general and of medical students in particular toward a policy issue which is important to their material interests, but which evokes ideological responses at the same time. The findings show that political ideology as well as objective and subjective self-interest are independent dimensions. Both factors are related strongly to medical students' attitudes toward national health insurance. Their relative strength varies considerably with the salience of the issue at hand. Almost uniformly, political ideology has a more pronounced impact on attitudes than does objective self-interest. The differences between the effects of political ideology and of subjective self-interest, however, are not always substantial or significant.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a model of motivated skepticism that helps explain when and why citizens are biased-information processors. Two experimental studies explore how citizens evaluate arguments about affirmative action and gun control, finding strong evidence of a prior attitude effect such that attitudinally congruent arguments are evaluated as stronger than attitudinally incongruent arguments. When reading pro and con arguments, participants (Ps) counterargue the contrary arguments and uncritically accept supporting arguments, evidence of a disconfirmation bias. We also find a confirmation bias—the seeking out of confirmatory evidence—when Ps are free to self-select the source of the arguments they read. Both the confirmation and disconfirmation biases lead to attitude polarization—the strengthening of t2 over t1 attitudes—especially among those with the strongest priors and highest levels of political sophistication. We conclude with a discussion of the normative implications of these findings for rational behavior in a democracy.},

At the policy debate stage, where legislative proposals are introduced, packaged, and debated, members' bill cosponsoring patterns reveal a multidimensional agenda. At the decision stage on the legislative floor, members' voting patterns reveal a low-dimensional agenda. This article compares the dimensional structures of legislators' bill cosponsoring and floor voting activities during the 103rd and 104th Congresses. The analyses show that bill cosponsoring contains at least three and as many as five distinct dimensions, suggesting that pre-floor legislative activities play an important role in structuring the lines of conflict for floor decisions. },

We combine this large dataset of Americans’ policy preferences with recent advances in opinion estimation to estimate the preferences of every state, congressional district, state legislative district, and large city. We show that our estimates outperform previous measures of citizens’ policy preferences. These new estimates enable scholars to examine representation at a variety of geographic levels. We demonstrate the utility of these estimates through applications of our measures to examine representation in state legislatures and city governments. },

Consistent with that hypothesis, racial attitudes had a significantly larger impact on health care opinions in fall 2009 than they had in cross-sectional surveys from the past two decades and in panel data collected before Obama became the face of the policy. Moreover, the experiments embedded in one of those reinterview surveys found health care policies were significantly more racialized when attributed to President Obama than they were when these same proposals were framed as President Clinton's 1993 reform efforts. Dozens of media polls from 1993 to 1994 and from 2009 to 2010 are also pooled together to show that with African Americans overwhelmingly supportive of Obama's legislative proposals, the racial divide in health care opinions was 20 percentage points greater in 2009–10 than it was over President Clinton's plan back in 1993–94.},

Using Bayesian Item Response Theory (IRT), we examine the contemporary contours of policy attitudes as they relate to ideological identity and we consider the implications for the way scholars conceptualize, measure, and use political ideology in empirical research. Although political rhetoric today is clearly organized by a single ideological dimension, we find that the belief systems of the mass public remain multidimensional, with many in the electorate holding liberal preferences on one dimension and conservative preferences on another. These cross-pressured individuals tend to self-identify as moderate (or say "Don't Know") in response to the standard liberal-conservative scale, thereby jeopardizing the validity of this commonly used measure. Our analysis further shows that failing to account for the multidimensional nature of ideological preferences can produce inaccurate predictions about the voting behavior of the American public.},

Thus, the democratic ideal of equal consideration is violated. Sample surveys provide the closest approximation to an unbiased representation of the public because participation in a survey requires no resources and because surveys eliminate the selection bias inherent in the fact that participants in politics are self-selected. The contrast between the participatory process and the sample survey is used to highlight the nature of the bias in the former. Surveys, however, are not seen as a practical way of providing more equal representation. },

  Abstract                 = {Prior to the 2010 health care reforms, scholars often commented that health policy making in Congress was mired in political gridlock, that reforms were far more likely to fail than to succeed, and that the path forward was unclear. In light of recent events, new narratives are being advanced. In formulating these assessments, scholars of health politics tend to analyze individual major reform proposals to determine why they succeeded or failed and what lessons could be drawn for the future. Taking a different approach, we examine all health policies proposed in the U.S. House of Representatives between 1973 and 2002. We analyze these bills' fates and the effectiveness of their sponsors in guiding these proposals through Congress. Setting these proposed policies against a baseline of policy advancements in other areas, we demonstrate that health policy making has indeed been far more gridlocked than policy making in most other areas. We then isolate some of the causes of this gridlock, as well as some of the conditions that have helped to bring about health policy change.},

Although the essence of the model ---reciprocity between legislators and contributors---is supported, the influence of contributions on voting is found to be substantially smaller than that of constituency, ideology, and party. Part of the explanation is that the dairy PAC's in 1976 "rewarded" congressmen who voted for price supports even when a congressman was compelled by his constituency to do so. We draw inferences regarding the influence of contributions by other types of groups and the influence on other aspects of the legislative process.},

This article first integrates academic and practitioner perspectives into theoretical arguments about targeted campaigning. Then, using the 1956 to 1998 National Election Studies, the analysis shows that voter registration and age have become increasingly important as criteria for campaign contacts, that contacting rates among urban, sub-urban, and rural areas have equalized, and that campaigns continue to target party regulars, people predisposed to vote, and those who are more socially and economically integrated into their communities. The analysis also compares major party grassroots strategies and their changes over time. The results suggest that recent patterns in personal-contact campaigning may no longer exacerbate American participatory inequalities to the degree found in earlier periods.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT Positions of influence over the legislative agenda provide greater opportunities for shaping policy outcomes. Do legislators take advantage of this? If they do, when the median is pivotal and legislators' goals reflect both position taking and policy seeking, greater influence over the agenda leads legislators to moderate their bills relative to legislators with lower agenda priority. Analysis of a formal game theoretic model provides rigorous justification for the proposition, and empirical analysis of House and Senate bills from the 101st to 108th Congresses using cosponsorship data to measure the ideological locations of bills largely supports it. Committee leadership and majority party status have moderating effects while the effect of committee membership is slight. The analysis also tentatively supports the pivotalness of the median over other alternatives. Contrary to the view that bill sponsorship is mere position taking, legislative organization significantly shapes early-stage legislative behavior. Specifically, greater legislative influence implies greater responsiveness to the median legislator. },

I find that a slim majority of Americans favors a semiautomatic weapon ban and proposals to make gun control laws stricter, and a large majority supports a federal background check law. Consistent with previous research, I also find that both instrumental concerns and cultural beliefs are significantly related to people's opinions about gun control, but the strongest, most consistent predictors of people's gun control preferences are their political beliefs and affiliations. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for the national gun control debate.},

We propose a simple model that converts this anomalous "error variance" into sources of substantive insight into the nature of public opinion. The model abandons the conventional but implausible notion that most people possess opinions at the level of specificity of typical survey items--and instead assumes that most people are internally conflicted over most political issues--and that most respond to survey questions on the basis of whatever ideas are at the top of their heads at the moment of answering. Numerous empirical regularities are shown to be consistent with these assumptions.},
