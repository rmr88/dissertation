# Data Appendix

This appendix describes specifics of all data sources to be used in the proposed dissertation.

Many of the analyses in the proposed dissertation will require similar data sources. Since the data used will be similar across chapters, I describe all of my proposed data sources here in the introduction. In each chapter, I will refer back to this section for specific details rather than repeating those details.

## Legislator and Bill Data

Data on bills comprise the main dependent variables for my analyses. As mentioned above, legislator ideologies can be measured using roll call votes or cosponsorship. I will collect data on bills and roll call votes from GovTrack (www.govtrack.us), an organization that compiles and standardizes data from various official records in a format that is easily usable by researchers and private citizens. GovTrack also has legislator-level data on committee membership, leadership positions, and partisanship. Cosponsorship data is available from either GovTrack or from James Fowler's website.[^1] Where it is appropriate to use roll-call based scaled ideology scores, I will use the common space DW-NOMINATE scores available on Keith Poole's website, voteview.com. I plan to conduct at least some analyses using both data on both the House and Senate, with exceptions noted in the chapters as appropriate.

It is also necessary, for some of my analyses, to identify the policy issues/ topics covered by specific bills. For this, I use the Policy Agendas Project data collected by Frank Baumgartner and Bryan Jones.[^2] This data is available for all bills between the 80th and 113th Congresses.

At some points in the study, it will be useful to have data on state legislators. One readily available data source for state legislator ideology is Boris Shor and Nolan McCarty's American Legislatures Project, which uses roll call voting and a recurring survey of state legislators to obtain scaled ideal point estimates for all state legislators on a single scale. The data are described in more detail in @Shor2010, and are available online from http://americanlegislatures.com/.

*[Other data on state legislators can be described here as necessary.]*

## Public Opinion

Measures of public opinion will also be obtained from a few different sources. Large-scale surveys provide actual public opinion data that is representative of voters at the state level, which is useful for analyses of representation by Senators. I plan to use two such surveys. The Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) is an Internet-based survey that began in 2006 and was conducted annually until 2012. The Annenberg National Election Surveys (NAES) began in 2000, and has been fielded every four years since then.

- Use IPs from Catalist
- could supplement with some survey data (CCES and/ or Annenberg) on major bills
- also, presidential vote share
- perhaps not relevant/ feasible for this paper, but has anyone ever used state-level elections to measure ideology in some sort of composite, factor analysis with pres. vote? (many issues with comparing state parties across states)

## Election Returns

- FEC
- Any other sources, specifically by district?
- State-level data?

## Issue Publics

- doctors (geo-coded CMS PUF practice data)
- uninsured (Catalist)
- Medicare/ Medicaid enrollees (Catalist has Medicare; could check CMS; also, could use Census age/ income profiles as proxies, or the Census SAE data)
	-could even use amount of Medicare/ Medicaid funding going to state (district?)
- hospitals in the district (could try to get that from CMS, HHS, or CDC)
- any way to get at cancer patients, etc.?
	
## Campaign Finance

- from CRP
- provider groups (doctors, hospitals, other providers)
- payers
- patient advocacy groups (esp. Medicaid/ low-income groups, AARP, etc.)
- what about devices, pharma, ancillary services, etc.?
- Party committees (state and federal), leadership PACs

## Other Data

- MC partisanship data
- income (Census?)
- race (Census?)

The data are described on Fowler's website, http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/cosponsorship.htm and in his peer-reviewed articles [@Fowler2006a, @Fowler2006b].

[^2]: Policy Agendas Project data was collected by Frank R. Baumgartner and Bryan D. Jones, with the support of National Science Foundation grant numbers SBR 9320922 and 0111611, and were distributed through the Department of Government at the University of Texas at Austin. The data and more information is available from the project's website, http://www.policyagendas.org/.
